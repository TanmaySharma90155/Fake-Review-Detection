# Fake Review Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Fake reviews have become a major challenge on online platforms, influencing customer decisions and damaging brand reputations. Ensuring the authenticity of reviews is essential for maintaining a fair and trustworthy digital marketplace.

This project aims to build an automated fake review detection system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing review text, user behavior, and metadata, we classify reviews as **genuine** or **fake** with high accuracy.
