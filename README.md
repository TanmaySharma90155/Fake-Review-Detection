# Fake-Review-Detection

Fake reviews have become a significant issue in online platforms, influencing customer decisions and business reputations. The authenticity
of reviews plays a crucial role in ensuring a fair marketplace. Various
factors, such as review text, user behavior, and metadata, can indicate
whether a review is genuine or fraudulent. Traditionally, manual methods
and rule-based approaches were used to detect fake reviews, but they are
inefficient and prone to inaccuracies. With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, automated fake review detection models are now replacing manual efforts. These models leverage historical data to classify reviews as genuine or
fake with high accuracy. In this report, we discuss various machine
learning techniques used for fake review detection, compare their
performance, and analyze their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our
goal is to determine the most efficient model for accurately identifying
fake reviews and mitigating their impact on online platforms. Keywords: Fake Review Detection, Machine Learning, NLP, Sentiment
