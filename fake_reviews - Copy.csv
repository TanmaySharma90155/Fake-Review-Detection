I had a friend who was a dog trainer and wanted to take her on a walk and had her harness in the trunk of the car. This was an excellent choice. The first time I put it on, the dog stopped barking and started running. I think this has helped. I just put it on and it seems to be working. I have a 60lb lab mix and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a dog with a big head or neck and wants to work on their head.

I have a 14lb lab mix and I like this harness to allow her to walk with ease. It is a bit awkward to put on, but it is sturdy enough to allow her to stretch out while walking. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a dog with a very large head or neck.

He had to be able to chew on it but it did a good job of getting rid of his nasty teeth. I have used it a few times and it has helped him feel more relaxed and he has a lot of energy. It was a good price and my dog enjoys it. I would recommend it. I got this to replace the old one I had. It's still holding up well, but it's not the best looking dog toy I've ever bought. I think it's just a little too small for my 6 month old dog. I wish the toy had a more durable handle. The material is good and it's durable. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a little more durable.

It does not clump on the carpet as I expected. The only thing I would say about these is that they are a bit big for a dog that is a bit small for a puppy. I like the fact that they are not all that hard to put on and it is easy to clean. The only thing I would say is that I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a long lasting brush.

The old one has a very low dust capacity, and the new one is a bit more active.

I also use it on my dogs when I'm away from the house, because it's easier to carry around than the other ones I've used. The material is nice and thick, so I feel it's a great value. I would definitely recommend this bedding. I'm not a fan of the cover on the back, but it's nice and thick, and my dog is comfortable with it.

I don't know if it will last as long as it did before I switched to this litter box but it is definitely worth the money.My dogs love this toy!  They play with it until they are bored, then they chase it and play with it for hours!  It's a great toy!  It's very sturdy and sturdy for our dogs.  We just took it out of the box and put it in the yard.  It was a little hard to put together, but the only thing I can think of is that it's made of a durable rubber.  I have two dogs, and they play with it and chase it until it's bored.  They're not all that interested in it, but it does seem to last a long time.  I think it will last a long time.This is a good product.  I have a 55 gallon tank that is very water resistant.  The quality is good"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,CG,"Let preface my review by stating that I am very disappointed in this product. I have used this product before and had no issues with it. The plastic part on the back is very thin and it does not hold up well to the biting. This is a very thin plastic with no edge. I have to leave it on the floor and it goes out of the way. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this product. This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they can't chew it up!  This is a great product for dogs that have chewed it up too. We bought this for a puppy that had chewed up a huge chunk of his front teeth. It's a bit flimsy, but it's sturdy enough to keep him from chewing on it. It's a bit on the smaller side for the size of a small dog. It's a little stiff for a small dog, but it's worth it for her to chew on it. The only downside is that it's not very easy to clean, and I find that it doesn't hold up well for her to chew on. I don't use this product on my dogs, but I do recommend it. I got this for my dog and she loves it. I bought it for her to be able to lay on a couch."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,This product is great and works well. It is thick enough to make it hard to throw. If you want to throw a tennis ball then the plastic part should be strong enough to go through it. It is a perfect size for my dogs and is perfect for them. I have 2 dogs with medium to large chests and they have never had problems with this ball. I just put it on them and they go to their feet. It is very easy to put on and take off. The only thing I wish I could do is let them just sit on it and it would be a good thing for them to not have to do that. I would definitely recommend this product. This is the best dog bed I have found. It's lightweight and is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for the last 10 years. It's well made and the only thing that bothers me is the fact that it is a little hard to put on but that's not a problem with the other dog beds I have used. My dogs go to the bed when they're hungry and this one is a little bit tougher on them. This is the only catnip my cat doesn't like.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"This is my first time using this and the dogs love it. My only complaint is the extra suction cup. I wish it came in the plastic one so it would hold up to the biting and biting. I would have liked it if it had a thicker plastic bowl. I would have liked to have gotten it in the plastic one instead. It has a very thin plastic base, so I wish I had bought it in the plastic one. I will have to check the size on the next time. I will update this review as I see it. I am really glad I bought this product. I would not have bought it in the plastic one. I have been using this to keep my dogs ears clean for several years and I have found it to be effective. It is very absorbent and absorbs more than my other shampoo products. I have not had any issues with skin irritation as a result. My cats love this food. They are about 20 lbs. They have been eating it for several years. The cats have never had any issues with the food, and I believe that it is a healthy food for them. I also have the odd cat that we mix with it, which is quite a challenge for us. The food is good quality and the cats love it. I will be ordering more of the other brands. Great quality. My dogs love it. I bought this for a friend who has a dog with a sensitive stomach. It's very easy to clean. It's not the best and there are some ways to get it out. I haven't used it yet but it seems to be working well."

60kg for medium sized dogs
retractable dog leash. Made of environmentally protection material TPE. ABS has a nice rubber grasp that is easy to hold and your hand does not slip off.
you press down on the black button to lock  and release to let it go. 4 meter cord.
the light takes three triple a batteries ( you have to provide those)
the light is very bright which I love. I live in the country so it is dark at night to take out the dog it is nice to have a built in light I do not have to search for. you can also take the light off if you want and hold it in your hand. I like to leave it as one piece so I don't lose it.
really well made hard durable plastic and the end of the leash has light reflector so you can be seen in the dark by cars.
I like this one very much and my pomerian who is three pounds can use it just fine."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"If they are shipped right they are supposed to be firm blocks that's easily crumbled into powdery flaky smell so good goodness for the cats (it appeals to my sense of smell and I HATE the smell of any wet can food)

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it. Just crumble it its so easy to squeeze it and seeing it just flake away. I like the ease of grabbing a firm block instead of a messy thing."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have several single layer rings which my cats will play with, but unfortunately, they (cats) always manage to get the balls out of the rings.  That has not happened with this multi-layered toy.  The cats love playing with it and I am happy to finally find something that stands up to them."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness."

However that's on me for not paying attention to the size. Works as described. Traps the litter. I just shake it out back into the litter box once a week. Now there's less tracking going on."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I am so angry. Frontline DOES NOT WORK. Idk where all these people live that frontline actually works, but they must not have many ticks. We live in upstate New York, where there are lots of ticks. I thought I was being a responsible dog owner and religously following the instructions and applying frontline. Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING. We switched to the seresto collar and its MUCH better! Dont waste your money on frontline. I have half a mind to sue them."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,The handle feels very cheap and the top roof is always loosened.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I really liked this, but keep in mind this type of tubing floats and cannot be used without some sort of anchor in ATO situations."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My ferret loves this Vitamin Supplement! I love this product and have purchased it for almost 5 years and will continue to purchase it for the well-being of my girl.  I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.

This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.

What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.

I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,My beagle really likes this food and I find it convenient ordering through Amazon

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Purchased for my 7 month old German Shepherd so she could ride comfortably in the car and look out the window. She does great and loves her new seat belt.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Wow,

  This is not clumping litter so forget the poop and scoop process. It is basically non clumping liter. I like Arm and Hammer but this is a horrible product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I have 3 Male Italian Greyhounds who have very hard to fit body shapes. If you can make a few quick stitches you can make the Gooby fit like a glove. The Gooby has an open V neck. I lay one side of the V over the other side of the V.  I then sew it together making it fit their skinny necks.  This also keeps the Gooby from sliding back next to their penis. This prevents the Male IG from peeing on their Gooby.  I use their Girth (chest) measurement to purchase the correct size. I will attach a picture of my Gooby already sew together.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,Large didn't fit well on my 65lb lab/pit mix. Luckily I was able to return...
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I could not have been happier.  The pups were not annoyed at all by their collars.  I kept an eye on them so they were neither to loose or too tight.  And MADE IN THE USA!!!!!

Now if we can just get him to stop biting."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Best choice for healthy cavies. Our three guinea pigs love these pellets, and our vet approves."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Tried it once. I have no idea if this works as well as people claim. But I laughed my ass off at Milo. He looked like I was trying to kill him. It was hilarious! The comedic factor alone is enuf to give this 5 stars!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Still holding up after a year with a tough chewer.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Even though I gave this 5 stars, I am not able to fully review how good the product is for helping dogs with joint problems.  My little dog is 16 years old and is very suspicious of anything different.  He did not like the smell of it, but that's nothing against the taste or quality of the product; he is a very picker eater.  The only way I could get him to eat is was to reduce it to powder and sprinkle it on moist foods that he really likes.  Amazon only gives you a certain amount of time to review the product on Vine, so I had to give up and review it.  The pills are big and a small dog only eats half, but they are scored and easy to break in half.  I really do think that they helped a little, the few times I could get him to eat them, but I think a liquid version of this would work better for him.  If your dog isn't picky, he'll probably like them, though."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,My crazy cats get litter everywhere even with the CatIT domed and covered litter box (which is the best box ever! Really helps to control odors!). I bought this pan mat to see if it would help. There is about 75% less litter on the floor around the box but still some getting on the floor around the mat.  Maybe my cats practicing their long jumps. Maybe they are doing it on purpose because they love to watch me sweep.  The mat is easy to clean and durable.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Booties appear to be well made. As cooperative as my dog was through all my multiple attempts to get the booties on his x-small furry feet, it was challenging and took time. He did his best hip-hop dance moves until he realized they weren't coming off."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"These are fantastic! We bought two for our two cats. When we decided to get a puppy, we immediately came back to buy one for him. The quality is amazing. Very durable. They hold up very, very well. The colors are bright and fun. No chipping, no fading, these really are just wonderful."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"It's a very good product as long as your dog is mannerly.  It will not take a super tough beating, so train your dogs, and watch them for a few days to make sure they are not pawing at it trying to figure it out.  Duh, I think you know where I'm headed here.  My one dog who ""knows"" how to use a doggie door wanted in the house but the slider was closed in back of the screen.  He worked so hard at trying to get in that he ripped out the doggie door from the screen.  Fortunately I was able to put the door back in, but about 30 more seconds and it would all have been trashed."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This harness worked out great foy both my beagles.  I purchased this one for my girl beagle and one in red for my boy.  I've had them for almost 5 months now and with constant wear they're still going strong.  There's a lot of adjustment room and both dogs are very comfortable in them.  Great product and great price!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Love, love, love this.  Keeps our dogs safe while travelling."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Great and Long Lasting harness. I've got one that I've been using for 17 years -- still looking good and doing what it's designed to do! I recently ordered another for a new dog. The harness goes on easily. My dogs get excited when I show them a harness -- they know they are going outside.

These harnesses are built to last. My old one is red with little paw prints (cute), which I don't think they make that color anymore. You can wash these harness in the washing machine and air dry.  I hope this company never goes out of business."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,A good probiotic is great for your cat. Most of them think this is some kind of treat sprinkled on their food.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,very handy for little ones.  quick shipping.  thank you.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I bought the ""pro pack"" It just comes with all of the filter media (Ceramic Rings, Carbon, and Bio Rings) And extra white and blue filter pads. This filter is easy to set up as long as you do everything right, It took me a while at first until I realized that the motor head wasn't put in right(Made a loud gurgling noise). but after that it worked perfect, the only noise you hear is a little hum. I've had it for about 2 weeks. and it has been keeping the the water crystal clear! which amazed me because turtles dirty water so much so fast. So I'm pretty amazed, I'd say the water clarity has never dropped below 90%. and I love it, This is a fantastic canister filter for the price, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good cheap canister, I really have nothing bad to say besides every once in a while I have to pump air out of it (I have aerators and live plants so my oxygen levels are really high) And it pulls the little microscopic bubbles through and they build up into bigger air bubbles. And one of my plants got sucked into the filter and clogged it (outtake was low flow), and the extra filter pads that came with were TOO BIG for the filter (I cut them to size). But as of right now everything works fantastic and I have no complaints otherwise. Just care for it properly, set it up right, and good luck!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,This dress is very cute but made a bit smaller than other Fitwarm brand size mediums. Also material is too soft which allows the sides to bunch together and hang on the floor.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is a nice silicon mat, it helps minimize the damage my dog makes while eating or drinking. However, my puppy is a sloppy drinker and there is still plenty of water on the floor after he finishes drinking. The mat is easy to clean and holds up (so far) to my puppy's attempts to chew it up."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Realatibely Inexpensive packed tight so expands to allow for several changes. Feels like a healthy choice for my Guinea Pig
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my 40 lb dog Cookie, but she wasn't the least bit interested because it was too hard for her.  I ended up giving it to my friend who has a pitbull named Bertha who is 75 lbs.  Bertha loves it & hasn't even put a dent in it... friend was so impressed, she'll be buying more for sure!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Cats seemed to enjoy this and no hairballs or hacking like before.  Cheaper here than in the store but was informed no longer available so I switched to Purina One for my kitties.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Perfect! Fits the python perfect! If you are debating on weather or not to get this or the bigger, go with the bigger. They aren't as big as you think, even though the length is correct."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Beagle doesn't like when it goes over her head but it is comfy and doesn't rub her raw anywhere. Other harnesses she was always trying to wiggle out of. When she takes off after a smell and reaches the end of the leash, the harness protects her from being jerked back."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I love this crate, although I did take one star off because when my dog is in there, he somehow manages to push the bottom tray half way out...but I love how big the crate is.  I have an Alaskan Malamute, and he is able to stand up and move around...and my little Shih Tzu Terrier mix can be in there with him and they can still move around.  My Malamute is a chewer, so this crate has certainly been a life saver for those times I'm not home."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dogs favorite toy. Wish more companies made these crinkle paper toys
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I was searching for a backpack to take my dog with me on bike rides. This one was more expensive than the other options, but it is well worth it. The sports sack is so well made - substantial canvas fabric, mesh air vents for those hot days, and two pockets for stashing keys and leash and things. Plus my boy loves it!  At first he wasn't thrilled about being stuffed into it, but now he gets all excited when I put it down on the floor because he loves coming along in my rides. He is always very content and fascinated by the scenery.

To put him in it, I place the unzipped sack on the floor and insert one paw into the appropriate leg opening. Then I grab his other leg and start to lift, which causes him to put weight on the first leg so I can pull the sack up on that side. Then I insert his second leg and clip the bag behind his neck. Next I lift and place his back legs, one at a time, into the sack, and after that I gently press on his rump to get him to sit down inside it. Finally I zip him up and lift him up to settle him down into the bag. Putting it in myself is the trickiest part, but I've gotten the hang of it after using it so much. I find it actually pretty comfortable to wear. It helps to cinch the straps and being the bag high up on my back.

For the fit, my boy is a 15 pound miniature poodle, long and lanky for his weight. I measured him according to the manufacturer's instructions, and his length was 17 inches, exactly on the borderline between small and medium. So I got a medium, and while it is roomy it doesn't seem too large. I haven't gotten the booster pad.

In summary, I recommend this sack highly!  It works so well for us and I am so grateful to this company for making such a high quality product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"we get this on subscription from Chewy now but have 11 cats and this food keeps them from puking all the time and they never reject it. We would get bags of other brands that all 11 cats would refuse at once so I know the food was bad.  Have not had that happen with Blue.  I have young to old cats, indoor and barn cats all of this food."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I had been feeding my two Beagles raw Chicken for over a year which was fine in the beginning. Then my female Beagle suddenly got allergies. After two shots of Prednisone, two rounds of oral Prednisone (all spread out in a span on 6 months), and a change in diet (cooked Potatoes and Fish/Beef), she still had allergies! I started giving them Natural Balance Vegetarian and all her allergies instantly went away. They have been on it for two weeks now.

Since I felt they needed protein, I gave them 1/4 lb. of raw beef each last night. They both instantly started to itch! I also bought Yoghurt so I guess I will just stick to that for protein for now."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Purchased this stroller September 2013 to help my beagle with a ligament issue in his back leg take a break on walks. At first I was happy with the quality of the stroller including the wheels (actual tires with inner tubes) and the ability to easily lock the stroller in place. It also gave us the freedom to go on longer walks. However as reported by another reviewer, despite the stroller saying ""up to 70 pounds"" this was completely inaccurate. As such, my dog would take up the entire stroller which put strain on some of the mesh panels which then began to unravel. Since the stroller did give us the freedom to move about I kept it and made repairs every time a section came undone though over time the separation in the fabric occurred all over the stroller and not just where he would lean. The stroller had major patchwork from all my repairs but I was going for function over looks. However, with continued use the frame became a quite wonky though still usable but the final nail in the coffin occurred today when one of the back tires broke off while we were using it. I'm going to research how much a spare tire would cost but frankly, after 2 1/2 years of intermittent use I expected it to last a  bit longer considering the price I paid at the time, $216 plus tax. If you have a small dog-less than 25 lbs, this stroller may work for you but if we decide to get another stroller I don't think I will go with this brand."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Product as described!!  Perfect,  My fur baby loves it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My 8 pound Rat Terrier Loves these. They are made of had plastic so they will last for quite a while.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I just received my feeders. I bought the 2 pack on Amazon. I just set it up so I'll update my review later once I've had it a while.

But for now, here are my observations. I have 5 cats. I find it hard to leave them for extended periods because it's too much for someone to scoop the litter and feed them etc. I boarded them once last summer. But it's not cheap and they are so trqumatized. I wanted to be able to go away for least a couple days. So I researched automatic feeders. I read all the reviews and some are very good some had issues. For this price for two, I decided to give it a shot...

Sturdiness: I real the instructions and set it up. I attempted to lift it by the lid just to test the sturdiness a little and it held nicely. I'm sure rowdy animals can get around that ... oh well.

Programming: Just like a clock, read the directions. Press buttons. It was easy. To test it, I put 5 cups in the hopper. And choose to dispense 1 cup at feeding.

Portion dispensed: After it dispensed, I measured the amount. It actually dispensed about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. But I've heard it sometimes releases 1/4 less the first time it rotates. So I'll see next time.

Sound: I was testing it so I stood right by it when it went off. Only sound I heard was the kibble dropping into the bowl. No loud grinding at all.

I am going to set the other one up and test them a few times and I'll update my review. So far so good...

Update: So I've had it a couple days now and it is dispensing what it says it will. Again, the only it makes is the food hitting the bowl. Cats were surprised the first time it did it while they were next to it. But now it doesn't bother them. So far, it's been a great purchase."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Easy testing and seems to be accurate when tested with other of its kind. My biggest  tank is 40 gallons and I only have soft  corals and not that many along with 8 fish a large arrow crab and a few hermits. My filtration devices keep my tank free of nitrates and phosphates, so I do not need any higher priced test kits for testing."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I purchased this package because the pads on the original filter is getting thinner and thinner. These pads are so much thicker and seems more durable. The four pads fit perfectly in my filter. I have not use the carbons as of today. I purchased them together because of the price and have these carbons as replacement in the future.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"It was hard to tell from the picture or the description whether the bowls were plastic or metal, and I unfortunately assumed the latter, but was wrong.  Plastic bowls are not great for most breeds of dogs, as they harbor bacteria, and obviously can be chewed, which can cause irritation and/or cuts and scrapes to the dogs face and mouth.  Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.  Because the design of this feeder is so round and wide, the ""legs"" are just slightly too wide for the tray in the bottom of the crate.  This would probably be a decent feeder for someone who doesn't mind lots of plastic or that have a larger area for the feeder.  It's definitely not compact or discreet, though it does seem to be sturdy for an all plastic product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Great leash, the length is great, and it has a firm hold with my dog. Just be cautious, they don't recommend using retractable leashes with choke chains and harness to stop dogs from pulling as there is constant tension on the leash."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I wish, as have others, that the price were lower, but after lots of looking, this is really the only unit that fits the bill.  It is robust, makes no noise during normal driving, is easily installed in my 1.25"" hitch, and is big enough for my dog to easily use to get into the rear compartment of my small SUV.  Would buy again and recommend to others."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Good overall, but my cats don't seem to like tuna, so a third of this is not well received by the kitty landlords"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This thing has been a life saver with our foster pups. Keeps the puppy pad in place so the rambunctious pups don't toss it around.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"My 3 months old kitty really love this toy but it broke the next day. The ""joint"" of the suspender is too weak to withstand the pull. I just cut off the string and let my kitty have the mouse instead."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,One of the bowls came with an unseemly surface crack. Otherwise nicely made. Wish they sold replacement bowls. Love the stand.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Absolutely awesome! I bought the 100 and 55 gallon filter for a 40 gallon cichlid tank and a 38 gallon tropical. They work well and keep the tank crystal clear.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My two cockatiels have a lot of fun with this!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"i mix it into a small amount of wet food, and it's spared me the dreaded vet visits.
has been a huge success, for the cats.  saved me $$$$$$$$$$, and the
stress of packing up the girls in a crate to go to that ""place"""
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,It works pretty good for my Finnish Spitz.  I only use it when birds are outside but it does the trick.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Lots of bouncing going every which way so dog has fun chasing it .
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is a great product.  So much better than those clear plastic ones. My dog seems a lot happier with this one.  She doesn't bump and scrape against things nearly as much.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My cats like it but they are like most cats, finicky.  They eat a few bites then come back for more later."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Update: I have a headache and sore throat after the second day I clean the carpet with this thing. It is not a cold. I think I am allergic to whatever it is in bottle. I am just going to use water from now on. It is very powerful and everything comes out. But if you are like me, don't use a lot of chemical around the house, you may have the reaction to it too.

It works very well and smell very clean."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,First puppy bows with  these tiny barrettes I have found.  The metal type that lock closed.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I have switched my dog from a mix of hills science diet and Rachel ray grain free nutrish (salmon)  to this over the past week.  He is a growing Bassett hound, 10 mo;  I know not everyone would consider this a large breed because  he is short, but I know that his breed can get up to 70 pounds full-grown.  He seems to like  The flavor so far, but he is not a terribly picky eater. I have been transitioning him  slowly on a graduated mix;  I have noticed that his stools, while still formed, have been a lot softer on the Iams mix.  Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that. This product lost only one star because the grain size makes this food a little harder to eat than others (including Eukanuba large breed, which he has tried before).  Other than that, it is a good product at a fair price and keeping my dog nourished at his high activity level.

Update:  dog still likes it and his poops are nice and firm, but the problem is that the grain size is so large, it is clogging my auto feeder. For that reason alone, I cannot buy it again."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"These treats were rock-hard, they have a slightly strange smell, and my dog wouldn't touch them. The regular is HUGE. One half of one was kind of big for my 19 lb dog. I can't say how digestible they are because he wouldn't eat them. 2 stars because they seem like a fairly good deal for the money-- if your dog will eat them."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"This gate is easy to install and looks good at first, however my very large 70 pound pitbull was able to get through the small pet door and harass my poor cat upstairs this gate ended up not serving its purpose of giving my cat a safe space away from the dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My cats seemed to like this at first, but now I haven't seen them on it since. They don't use it as a scratcher either, they just use it as a lounge. The product itself is fine, my kitties are just picky."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My cat loves greenies period, but we were having a bit of a hairball issue.  We tried the soft chews, but she just wouldn't eat them after trying them once.  She however loves the Greenies, and goes crazy when she sees the bag, I think she loves the crunch, and they are just the right size for her.  Since we started no more hairball issues."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I prefer the Probios Gel, but since it is much more expensive and must be refrigerated, I usually only purchase it for one of my dogs, who has ulcerative colitis.  The other dogs get the powder form, which seems to work just as well for them.  If one of them seems to have any bowel upset, which seldom happens, I'll switch them to the gel for a few days."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I personally have not tried this but my dogs seem to love this stuff. Of course, they will eat dead rats and rocks so the recommendation has a limited reach."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"This is the second time it broke in the same area, the part where you push to close door and lock it.  They gave me a new one.  I have only had this a year with light use and it broke again.  Super annoyed, do not waste your money."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Exactly what I needed. My sweet kitty likes to pee in the back of her box and kick up litter like nobody's business. I used to have a regular box with a litter shield but it didn't fit snugly enough in the box and litter would fall through. I like that this is one solid piece and that it is smaller and can fit well under the sink where I keep her box.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Best. Toy. Ever. We put his meals in it and it keeps him going for half an hour.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This product was specifically recommended for our old cat who was a bit anemic.  Once she was on this, that was no longer the case!  It doesn't have a dropper included, however (thus, not a five star rating) so you have to find a way to get it into the pet.  But it worked wonders for us."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Once again the dumb people on Amazon reviewing products amazes me. Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous. This bed is though, and I love how you can buy covers for it as well as the plastic feet that don't scratch the flopractice  (I have since purchased 3 for indoors). Overall it's a perfect bed unless you are unreasonable."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,I was disappointed in this.  Maybe it's just my cats but they could of cared less when I sprayed it on things.  I will try something else next time.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I have a chihuahua and I bought the medium and my dog LOVES this. I added another little blanket in it for extra padding like she likes. And she doesn't leave this high seat. I would recommend this highly.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"AMAZING!! Since I moved into my home 4 years ago, I have been trying to remove a lingering urine smell from my bathroom.  This bathroom has wood floors and no matter how much I cleaned and scrubbed, that smell was always there.  I figured it got in the cracks of the wood.  Followed directions on this product and I am no longer embarrassed when guests use my bathroom.  The smell is gone!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"On New Year or July 4, or when other noise events are stressing the cats out, we hand these out and the felines are much happier.  I do wish the treats were a softer texture - they're a bit stiff for the gums of small or elderly cats and when you try to break them they crumble.  We now use a paring knife, which does the trick."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Great thick material but my 8 week old kitten is too small for the x small still.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,It's nice to have something handy for the dogs that you don't need a prescription.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I would never order these again. If I could take a photo and show you how yellow these are I would. I hate to see what is coming into my healthy cats water right now. Go to the other buyer I bought them from, look at my history, his were perfect. He has my business from now on."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I use this mat to protect my floor from a litterbox, and it's worked perfectly. No leaks or stains on the floor and it catches a lot of litter. I'd order bigger if I could go back in time."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instructions except I used a planter and did 2 containers instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds.

After a few days in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it was growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it was full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it was growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered as I've been careful hoping to prevent that.

One of our two kittens eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bites some off and plays with it. I put some clippings in their nightly dinner. No issues with vomiting and they both eat it just fine.

At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the containers and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold.

I read that overwatering cat grass turns the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets.

Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though as mold growth has everything to do with moisture. The grass was lush, green, healthy, and the roots are strong and deep. 4 stars because it only lasted us a month but we will give it another shot.

USDA Organic. Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. The photo collage was after 5 days of growth, when the kittens first tried it. The last photo was on the 7th day, when the grass had become more full in growth. Smile. Recommended."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Love it and use several times a day, good product made well."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My 12 year old sheltie has bad hips, which I guess is common for his age and breed.  Before a vet recommended this product, we were helping our dog stand up after laying down for too long, and my husband had to carry him up and down stairs in order to go outside.  This was three years ago, and I was sure it was about time to put him down.  He's a little slow going up and down stairs, but he does it on his own now.  He gets up and down on his own and follows me around just like he did when he was a puppy.  He's a happy dog and still as loveable as always.  If we accidentally run out of Nutramax Cosequin DS, he starts to limp and slow down within a week.  This has truly been amazing .. I wish they made something that worked this well for humans."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Appears to work as described.  We put a battery in it, turned it on and set it out.  So far our dog has not ventured into the room we closed off.  The device makes a loud noise and she does not like loud noises.  I believe this will be fine for our uses, may buy a longer one for additional room."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My Pekinese wasn't too happy after the 3rd bark.  Shut him down really fast.  So he's good for 2 barks and knows what happens after the 3rd.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dogs have eaten every one of their treats - will look for them again and purchase them again .
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Unfortunately, this product is not available in my town, but it is online. My elderly dog was having problems with appetite and taking in enough food, so I used Dogsure as a backup, administered by syringe, along with her liquefied regular food, into her mouth. She liked it. Although there is a similar product readily available for humans, this is formulated for dogs."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,I use as a topping for their regular food as they love a little variety.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I want all of the guinea pig world to know these EZ whelp pads are awesome. This is so much better than fleece and totally cost effective. I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.
Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"rabbit loves it, only wish it was inside of another 2 bags or something to keep it fresh longer. box is pretty big. however, if you have the right enclosure attach box to side of cage and just cut some holes in side of the box and let the bunny eat away"
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Came with a strong repellent plastic smell and it was folded in the bag so hard that it flattened over a month's time. It could be either the reason why my cat first willingly got on it after 3 weeks. And albeit on my bed, it's now still competing with my pillow and comforter and my face for my cat's butt.
The power is really low. Covering a comforter on it all day cannot raise the temperature for me to feel very warm so I doubt it makes a difference for cats who have higher body temperature than human"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I bought one of these for my Marineland Heartland 60 Gallon tank (essentially a tall 55 Gallon at 24"" high) with a center brace; a perfect fit, so I'm buying a second!

4/5 because the glass edge was very slightly chipped on one small section, but not enough to warrant a return. Also, the outer shipping box was not the best in the world...soaked and crushed by FedEx. Thankfully, the canopy itself was unharmed.

I've no idea why some people are finding it difficult to attach the backstrip, unless it's just down to manufacturing variations. Mine slid straight on with no issues."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Adorable. Our pitbull has a very thick neck so finding a costume for him can be difficult. I was surprised this fit him with room to spare.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Our dogs love these treats and these are great for training treats!
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Decent product, but my puppy slid it all of the house and eventually got out."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Needed something as my pup has all of the sudden started getting frightened in the car and keeps trying to get on my lap. She's not a lap dog so this is quite dangerous. It works very well. It attaches to your child seat anchors on the back of the seat of in the crevice of the seat and the other end to your harness. We have a ruff wear harness that is very good so she stays put nicely.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,perfect for my 1lb puppy and he absolutely loves it!
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"While the ingredients are great, I have very picky bitches and neither will eat it. I even went as far as mixing their daily dosage with the entire can of their very favorite canned food, and nope, they won't touch it. Going to attempt the Bitch Pills and see if we have any luck, or will go back to OxyMate, which I firmly believe in, just wanted to give this a shot to bring in a successful heat for my older bitches last heat before retirement."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I've never used a clear treatment that actually keeps 100% of fleas off my dogs. But the idea is that they bite the medicated dog and die so they don't reproduce in my carpet and infest my house and that hasn't been a problem so that's a win lol
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"It's hard to tell if these work. I give my dog three tablets, which he takes willingly,  in the morning before I go to work. I don't think it chills him out all day because he's still pretty hyper and anxious in the evenings. He likes them, though!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My lovely big cat can't get to it after a feed which is a huge plus!!!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This rebound liquid diet is phenomenal stuff. I fed this to my late ailing cat and it helped nourish him when he needed it the most. The reason I bought it in the first place was that it contained a thorough mixture of nutrients for when the cat or dog was at a critical stage of health and was safe to force-feed.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,These are some of my dogs favorite treats. If they had a choice they would get them all the time if they could.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,I tried on our dog who is allergic to fleas and didn't work like said. arrived on time when said was pleased with sender just not product

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,The stitching is horrible!!!!!!!! The one picture I have here shows a small string pointing up. That was the only thing holding it together spend extra money and get something better
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is an excellent product.  We have had it only a short time, but it's great to find something that really works made by people who really care that their customers are satisfied.  Ask a question, and they will do their best to answer it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I always feed my dogs and foster dogs this.  I never have a problem transitioning them from the shelter food to this and now skin issues!!!  Dogs eat and love it.  Recommend it to all people that adopt!
Wonderful food."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"my second time buying, my cats see the can and run! It's so easy to train them with this."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Too short for my needs, but its a good leash.  I'll just donate it to the animal shelter, that way it isn't a complete loss."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Oxbow is the brand I rely on to most generally always give me the best quality Timothy Hay for my guinea pigs.  It generally has all green in its stalks and seeds.  Since hay is produced in differing areas during different seasons, and many places have a spring harvest and, I think if lucky enough, a fall harvest, you can't always get premium quality in each and every bag.  But I do count on Oxbow.  Best bet for the dollar spent."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,Buyer beware! This is not safe for KITTENS! My two month old kitten got her head stuck between the arch and the post. I manually pulled the post away to free her. She gagged three times immediately afterwards but seems fine now. If I hadn't have been there she could have perished! The space between the arch and post is too big for a baby kitty.

WHERE IT IS MADE: This is made in CHINA. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Buddy-USA-Rawhide-Braided-Sticks-for-Dogs-7-to-8-Inch-2-Count-Pack-of-1/dp/B005GWVWJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Buddy USA Rawhide Braided Sticks for Dogs, 7 to 8-Inch, 2 Count (Pack of 1)</a>&nbsp;is from the USA.

INGREDIENTS: Made ingredient is BEEFHIDE vs rawhide. Rawhide is the inner layer of the hide of any cleft-hoofed bovine livestock. Beef-Hide is premium rawhide made from cows raised for consumption. So, this is just another form of rawhide that is from cows as opposed to just any animal with a cleft hoof.  The Healthy hide rawhide has some extra potato starch, salt, soybean oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and preservatives.  The Healthy Hide sticks have almost ZERO SMELL.

SIZE:  These are really small pencil sized rawhide treats (see pictures) and are too small for my 45 pound dog (medium size dog).

The Healthy hide sticks come with 20 sticks but they smell like plain old rawhide and my dog just leaves it lying around.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Adorable and true to size, I love ordering from this company and will continue to do so !!"
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"These are good at creating bubbles. However, they start ""shedding"" with moderate use and cleaning. My hydroponic reservoir had a little bit of algae in it, so I needed to clean the airstone as well. Bits and pieces kept coming off of it. After the cleaning, I noticed bits of the airstone falling off into the reservoir every day.

Considering these are less than a dollar each, it's not the worst thing in the world. However, I really would prefer they didn't ""shed"" into my tank."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I seen, i bought and i put in the fish are happy yet again.."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,The leash is great but I had ordered blue and received a black one. Not a huge deal so I kept it.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I have to put the disclaimer out there that we are not done training!! This is why I've only given 4 stars. I had to pause in the training as we went away (kitty went with) and didn't want to thoroughly confuse the poor guy!

I have a young Maine Coon. He's approx. 17lbs. The CitiKitty has no trouble holding his weight. I considered toilet training after meeting a woman who has four cats and 1 bathroom. She and her husband trained their four cats to all use the toilet. It made me chuckle when she told us about it, but it stayed in the back of my mind.

I got tired of stepping in litter - the Big Naughty is a slob! - and remembered the toilet training scenario mentioned above and decided to look into it.

Week 1:
The first week this worked really well. The Big Naughty didn't have any accidents.

Week 2:
After removing the inner ring, Naughty wasn't as big a fan of going on the toilet. He had a few accidents, and once he started going on the toilet again he decided he didn't like (or couldn't figure out) to go poo in the toilet; so he would go on the floor beside the toilet. As suggested we kept the ring at the week 2 mark for an extra week, but then I went away for the holidays and took him with me so I decided to put the training on hold until after we returned so as not to confuse him.

I've yet to commence training again, I have quite a busy schedule. I am looking forward to starting again and completing the training. I dream of the day I do not step in the scattered litter on the bathroom floor, no longer having to sweep litter up daily, no longer buying litter, no more scooping litter, etc.

I will update more thoroughly once we make the concerted effort to train again."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"All 3 of my cats love this stuff. Seems like a great, simple (and hopefully healthy) treat. It's a bit pricy but well worth it to see how excited the furry babies get when I shake the container."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My car will only eat this brand and flavors of cannet food
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I absolutely love this harness for my Yorkies. So nicely made and pretty! I always used harnesses on them and I really LOVE how this one fits and looks. It is not cheaply made like some I have purchased in the stores. Im ordering another one for my other yorkie.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"buy a size slightly larger...
Chilly Dog Cable Dog Sweater,  which I have reviewed and is without any constraints in
covering the dog quickly and better by far!  you get what you pay for."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"My veterinarian recommended this product for my dog who has an intervertebral disc problem.  She does not have arthritis. My dog was also given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, rimadyl, for a month, and put on restricted walking. These are probably responsible for my dog getting better. I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit. So it is unlikely that my dog will benefit much from this particular product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Love these boxes.  My cats like them too.  I think it's the clear lid and all that room!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We have a large, 15lb cat and he is quite long and leggy. We feared this would not be large enough for him, but that is not the case. He is able to comfortably sleep on this window bed and it has stayed in place without fail. I was hesitant, but the suction cups work very well so there is no fear of it falling. However, our cat tends to get hyper and loves to run and jump. Upon jumping on this bed from about a foot above, the suction cups gave way and scared our cat enough to keep him away from it for a few days. He has since recovered and now sleeps on his window bed most mornings to warm himself in the sun. He didn't care for the texture of the actual bed so I threw a blanket over it and that did the trick."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"These are really flimsy and tear easily. I will keep buying them though, because they are the only ones I can find that fit the Littermaid box. I do use them with a bag, which makes them more cost effective because you can use them more than once. Overall, they're fine for what they are."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I love training with positive reinforcement so this tool is great. We have an older dog who isn't as ""motivated"" to go outside as he once was but he does learn what causes treats to come his way quite quickly. With this tool he knew what to do the 2nd time around and has since become very close ""friends"" with his new potty area that gives treats. Great tool, especially for a treat motivated dog."

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I have a Taiwanese Mountain Dog and she hates these treats. I break a piece off and try to feed her and she moves her head and goes ""nope nope nope"". I tried hyping up the food for her. Sometimes I would say "" Xiao Hei! Come eat!"" and I would throw her the treat (she likes to catch food in her mouth). Nope, She would catch the liver treat and then spit it out. I'm very sad. Also these treats are a little smelly."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I was contacted by this vendor to provide a review in exchange for a discounted price.  That said,  I'm glad I purchased this toy.  My male cat especially goes crazy over it.  My female cat hasn't bothered with it as much but hasn't been feeling well in general.

Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.

Two items I would like to see the vendor improve would be including felt pads underneath so it doesn't scratch my wood laminate floor (I will add some felt furniture pads underneath).  Second, increasing the post diameter at least one inch. Currently it's under three inches and a little narrow."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,It's OK not as loud as I would like.  It's loud enough for the house but not over about 70 feet

But, what a find!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very good ear cleaner for my dogs. One of them has a real problem with overgrown yeast and this helps keep it under control although the problem goes away, once I stop using the Zymox it comes back quickly so I use it on a consistent basis. The dog is also treated with probiotics to control the yeast at the gut level."

I have no Problem with any other plants in my tank. These were just cutting no roots or anything. I have co2. Just not a good plant, well bowl of trimmings."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dog's favorite toy.  (He's a Maltese, 8 pounds)  He will retrieve it,or play tug of war with it, and comes running when he hears the squeaker."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This crate has been great for our 3 month old Corgi. He takes up about one-third to one-half of the crate right now, so we have been using the divider. It's great that we will still be able to use this crate when he is full size."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog drinks from it every time he walks by. And it holds a good amount of water. I recommend it to everyone I meet
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My kitten enjoys beating up and bunny kicking this catnip banana toy. The catnip smells really strong and seems to be high quality. I think my kitten is too young to be affected by the psychedelic qualities of catnip yet so maybe he'll grow into this toy even more. I am going to get the other toys from this brand because they seem pretty durable, fun and cute and what matters most is cats like them."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,These different flavor small milk bones is the way to go for when it is bed time it a snack but not enough to require a extra drink of batter. So perfect for nighty night time.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,Goes off on its own when the dogs are no where around it!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I have NO idea why anyone would give this product a bad review. My Chameleons LOVE them ! I am sure that Bearded Dragons would love to lay under their lights on top of them also. (I BIND two together with plastic bread ties and tie them thru the screens in the cages) You need to replace them every 3-6 months so they don't draw gnats. CHEAP enough to do that ! Kathy
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Great training tool for my little puppy. She learned to walk really well with this. Only drawback is that it chafed her armpit if she pulled more. Also, would be better if the clasps were up higher rather than at the armpit. This also is what chafed her."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,If your cat is playful you will find that every toy in this multi-pack they will love. Great and inexpensive purchase for hours of play.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Has bought a second barrel, and my three tortoises like to eat."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Two cats: One who is picky loves this food.  The other prefers Purina Fancy Feast dry food.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My favorite litterbox of all time. My cat actually uses the litter box instead of outside of it. Where have you been all my life
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I was hoping my two male cats would like it.  One of them will eat one or two pieces, the other just walks away from it.  Going to have to donate the whole box to the Animal Shelter.  Maybe they will have better luck."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,These are excellent pet tags! I've ordered them for my three dogs and two cats as well as several fosters. The quality is great and they ship quickly. Love the variety of shapes and the way the info looks printed on them. I made a mistake on an address once and the company promptly corrected it for me as soon as I contacted them. They're so cute and reasonably priced that I ordered several more as Christmas gifts for family members pets.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is such a nice bed for my senior cat who weighs about 17 pounds. She absolutely took to it the minute I put it down for her. She was sleeping on a crate pad which was put back in the crate. She won't even leave this to go sleep in her favorite chair!
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,My polish rabbit seems to like it and loves picking through it for her favorite bits.  I was pleased with the hay and it arrived promptly .
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is essentially just a hang-on-back sponge filter.  It has very powerful flow, but can be adjusted.  I like that, as opposed to other sponge filters, it doesn't have to sit in the tank, so it takes up less of the fish's space in an already small tank. It's really important to note, though, that because this is simply a sponge filter, it is imperative to avoid rinsing the sponge on the intake or in the filter with chlorinated water or you'll kill all the good bacteria that consume the ammonia and nitrates."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,We had our pup on Purina Puppy Complete and he wasn't really eating it - we switched to this and he now can't wait to eat his meals. It has been great for us!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"If your dog has skin problems this is the greatest healing shampoo ever. Yes, I would recommend this product ."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cats like this hairball remedy more than any other.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"The kabana does cover the litter box on all sides but I'm not impressed for the cost.  The instructions for assembly were not as clear as needed.  It is not sturdy.  Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Tabatha loves these!  They even get her back from neighbors yard over 9' Wall.  And from everywhere else in house or yard + most importantly:  Stops her from biting our toes
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"It looks great, especially for tall dogs, but if the leash is very short it would be inconvenient on a short dog. Can anybody tell me how far the leash pulls out? Thank you."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We have an American Airlines pet carrier.  It has a ""furry"" pad that pulls out.  This disposable pad fits over this furry pad perfectly.  Yes it is somewhat thin, but I think it will do the job very well.  Will find out in less than 2 weeks and will report back.  On our last trip with our cat, she went #2 and what a mess!!  I think these pads would have kept the carrier clean, probably not help with the cat though!  We shall see....hopefully she doesn't have an accident."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,Lasted 15 minutes with my 2 year old Wheaton Terrier. He got the squeakers out and finished off the rest.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cat loves this toy. She'll run all the way from one end of the room then take a swing at the ball then sprint to the other side of the room. She love it.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This plant is beautiful but my fish have the bad habit of pulling her leaves thus I have to keep replanting it. Still it has grown new leaves
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,A must have in the cage for your birds. Mine love it.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Oh, i love this product! Nice looking AND durable material. Easy to open, wheels are a super idea. Makes it easy to move around the garage. I bought another one the day i received the first one.
I use one for cat food, one for dog food. Now I'm thinking of ordering two more- one to store rice in and one for bird seed! Maybe a couple more...flour perhaps? Lol.
Arrived on time, packaged well.
Highly recomend."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I am so relieved she does not fight to put it on. It keeps her from jumping into the front seat and actually helps keep her somewhat calm in the back seat.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,I found a piece of plastic in one of the treats I have a picture if you would like to see it
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"My 5 dogs and 3 puppies all would not eat this & the usually love everything!! My daughter' dog got sick when she mixed it 50/50

We raise Goldendoodles, and I had HIGH hopes that my puppies would love this as I've been researching high quality dog foods.... well it doesn't matter how high the quality is supposed to be if the puppies/dogs won't eat it! NONE of my 5 adult dogs or 12 puppies ages 2-8 month old puppies would eat it straight. I've been having to mix in meat drippings to get them to eat any of it and it caused SEVERE digestive upsets in ALL my dogs! Also when I bought mine (it was on sale) I told my daughter to try it for her dog & she had the same problem, she was mixing it 50/50 with his regular food and where he normally ate 1 bowl a day, his bowl sat for 3 days and still had kibble in it and he also had an upset stomach from the little he ate and she was up cleaning his ""accidents"" and this dog that had never had one, had several in the middle  of the night !! If this was any good (*& my dogs liked it) I was going to order 20 bags at the sale price of 2/3 off! But now I know why it was so heavily discounted. The dogs won't eat it and it makes them sick! My dogs are Goldendoodles that my son raises hers is a small Havanese that can dehydrate quickly so 3 days of  severe GI problems  trying to introduce a new food was about the limit for her. He is back on his normal food and his tummy is doing better! I DO NOT recommend this food even if it was FREE!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"The treats are dangerously sweet, savory, and delicious. So much so that if I accidentally leave the bag out my two cats will tear the bag open with there teeth and claws. Unfortunately I've had to buy another bag after that experience of kitten gluttony, but they seem to love it. I'd recommend this treat for any feline owner."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I love this for so many reasons!  I have to take my 16 lb. cat to the vet and I use this carrier.  You can roll it, and I did that once, but the sidewalk is so uneven and it was noisy so I didn't want to stress him out with the bouncing around. So now I carry it on my back like a backpack, it is real easy to get on and off, padded straps are comfortable.
One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket. The screen on the top and sides gives the cat some air, and it can be covered if it rains. I think it is the perfect item."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.

I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed. I was able to put it together by myself in about 45 minutes.

It's bigger than I expected it to be, but it will be worth it for happy birds."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,Burns cats eyes so do not want to keep doing that to my pet.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"my cat loves it. but for the price, the quantity is very less. hence feels expensive product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I bought this for my 125 pound dog and he loves it. I don't put a treat in it cause the ones I used just fell out. My big guy just chews on this all day.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,Arrived promptly & good value but my cat did not care for them.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My picky dogs love these! I will be ordering more eventually.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Although I am not completely convinced these work, we are on our third bottle. We have noticed that the dead spots are decreasing but we still have them occuring. We just moved to a new home so I look forward to seeing if there is any difference."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,Too expensive for such a simple item .Shouldn't cost more than a styrofoam cup
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Love my Lupine!  I've used lupine collars for over 10 years, and with each collar, halter, and lead that I bought, they all lasted FOREVER!  Lupine is the only brand dog collars/halters/leads that I will ever use.  The one time my mastiff pup got a hold of one of the leads and chewed through it, the lifetime guarantee kicked in and it was replaced with no problems.  This martingale is wonderful and helps with walk-training my pup and the best part is that it will grow with him."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my 6 month old labradoodle puppy.  She was never a horrible puller, but I didn't like feeling like I was choking her when I corrected her on a collar.  I took her to a large social event today where hundreds of children and parents were present-- the harness seemed to keep her from jumping up (something that she frequently does)  and I really liked the fact that when I did correct her for not heeling at my side she responded well from the harness pressure and I didn't feel like it was hurting her.  The product seems well made, but again I've only used it once. I was torn between ordering a s/m verses a med. She is currently 30 pounds and has a petite build. I ended up purchasing the medium.  When tightened all the way it fits her well-- a tad big but she is still growing."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Max finally killed Captain Kurklops. The last of his stuffing was in my hallway when I came home yesterday. He now happily carries around the rag wherever he goes.

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog would begin for these. The tiny ones are the best for my small dogs.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I just set this up today, so I don't have a long-term review for this but here's what I like about it so far. It's very attractive (shocking for a pet fountain), because it's ceramic rather than plastic. So much better looking than the plastic ones I've had before. It looks like a decor piece instead of pet fountain, which makes me feel less like a crazy cat lady. And Emily, my cat, has already approved it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope it will last a long time."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog really loves this toy for a game of tug of war.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Please be sure to read the dimension page  very carefully. I didn't and the unit was smaller than I realized. But thats on me. The product came well pkg'f. It's very easy to cll

MUCH smaller than I realized. Everything about it is miniature, this should not be advertised as a cats water fountain.  More like something for a t-cup.  I have it set up for now but I'm sure I'm going to toss it."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,not all my hens have warmed up to it yet but love how easy it is to clean...
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"First, this ball is very large for a dog toy, like the size of a large grapefruit.  My dog plays with it off and on.  It's proven to be durable, even when he grasps it in his mouth and shakes the living daylights out of it.  (Dog is 70 lbs. pit/yellow lab mix.)

I also have the ""luna"" ball, which is glow-in-the-dark.  I like these because my dog can't fit the entire thing in his mouth at the same time, and because the rubber is durable."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,They chewed through the bottom of it so not good to live in
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This review is for the Mighty Paw Leather Dog Collar.

I purchased this for my new puppy. My dog's old collar was wearing out and I came across this one and decided to try it. It looks good and seems to be made of solid material. I purchased the matching leash to go with it. I have a 6 month old bichon frise puppy and the collar was too big for him - I grabbed a pair of scissors and pierced a hole (took a few minutes to pierce through which tells me the material is good) and I cut the length as well. I did not measure the collar so not sure if the length is correct or not (as advertised) thus did not take any stars away for this.

I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. I am not obligated to write a positive or a negative review. If a product is poor, I will state so without any hesitation. All of my opinions are my own. If you found this review useful, please click 'Yes' below."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Grainy, thin and my animals didn't like it.  Threw it out."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,I bought this because my old clippers were not cutting the nail cleanly. It kind of left the nail ragged. This one is the same as my old pair.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent! Works great, packaged well. If you're looking for an inexpensive nail clipper, this is the one."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This ball is great, our Catahoula Heeler, Rambo, loves to play with Timmy (we named the ball this when Rambo shoved it into the well ).  The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside. This is not a toy your dog could play with inside if you were doing anything requiring your puppy to be quiet."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We were amazed how fast we got back our results. The vet thought our dog was Schnauzer/Wheaten Terrier, but he wasn't. He is Schnauzer/Poodle!  Now we know what health risks to watch for."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Super bright. Holds up well in the marsh so far
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Our dogs love these, and we haven't seen any adverse reactions with their stools, like some treats have."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cats love this food. They gobble it up. It smells good and stays down for hours without any problems.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,So someone told me about this---and I wanted to get a quality dog food without a lot of corn or fillers and this product gets eaten by my precious pekes.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This has been a great tag holder.  I can put it on my dog collar, and move it to another collar easily when we change to another collar. It fits my 1"" collar just right."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I love this filter, really keeps the water cleaned and clear."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is my second time purchasing The Tree. My Flemish Giant peed on the first one and there was no way to clean it, since it's made with untreated wood and sisal. It's strong and well constructed, holding up to being gnawed and tossed around by a pretty large guy. There are no small parts for little mouths to swallow and choke on.

My bun tends to ignore his toys for a while (as in a few weeks) before deciding to play with them, and may even decide to ignore them again. That's definitely been the case with this toy, but the quality and the fact that it's made right here in the U.S. without questionable materials makes it worth the cost."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I am impressed with the quality and durability of these cat toys. I bought the first one, single speed, then this one with variable speeds. They both have features I like and also things I think could be improved, but they don't shut themselves off every time the cat stops it like some do (a good thing!), and its very quiet except for an enticing little sound it makes sometimes, kind of like a squirrel chirping only not that loud. I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off. My cats tend to do a lot of watching and some active playing with them. At least it keeps them occupied some of the time!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Update: We've had these for over a yr now & they still work like new. I leave them in a drawer, so a lot of times when I grab them...they haven't been plugged into the charger in months... they just always seem to have a full charge...its crazy.
They also work perfectly with our Morkie's fine, silky hair.
They are so quiet, the dogs don't even seem to know when they are turned on :)

They work like a dream!
After purchasing many 'top of the line' clippers, that did not live up to their name. ..I was afraid to waste more $ on another set of useless clippers.
These are pleasantly quiet.
Trim easily.
Have always operated at full power (we've had them for 5 months)"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"With 1 large dog and 3 little ones, I have to keep up with the back yard. This is the best item I have found. Easy to use, handles the 'larger' situations very well. I wouldn't order a smaller one, this is the most logical purchase."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cats can't tell they are taking it and my cat we adopted from the shelter is doing much better!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This jacket arrived weeks earlier than expected, a pleasant surprise.  It is thick, soft & warm just as described.  And it is lovely!  The size small (tag says med) I ordered fits my 4.6 lb. Chiweenie well except it is a little long on her back extending down over the base of her tail. This will not be a problem as I just tuck it under a little when she wears it outdoors and it stays tucked.  The extra length will be nice to keep her warmer when she wears this for other purposes.  I love the 3 snaps on the underside of the tummy as it makes this garment easy to put on & take off.  I also appreciate the ribbing around the sleeve openings & bottom hem as this should provide durability.  Just wish there was a leash opening at the base of the hood.  It looks darling on her & I recommend this snuggly highly."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Have been using on my Maltese for years.  She always smells so good after her bath, and I don't worry about this burning her eyes or skin as it is so gentle."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Wonderful dog treats my dog loves them no holes in the box came in great shape
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My cat, Raoul purchased this during a nocturnal shopping spree. We got him his own credit card with the hope that occasional nighttime internet shopping would entertain him while the rest of the household slept. This works out pretty well most of the time as he usually purchases small inexpensive items such as cans of tuna, bags of Pounce, and electronic dog whistles.

One night, however, he watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0036SLOP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>&nbsp;on Amazon Instant Video and he became extremely interested in flying.  For a few weeks he would climb up on to a tall bookcase and spring, legs outstretched, usually on to the sleeping dog, but sometimes at any unsuspecting passerby.  He must have eventually become bored with free flight because this Cat Airplane arrived one day. Raoul set upon assembling the cardboard pieces and although he was quite methodical, it was beyond his physical ability to complete the job. Of course, we assisted him; the propeller assembly being extremely difficult even for us with thumbs.

At last, the cat airplane was finished and the first thing we noticed is that the cockpit was rather a tight squeeze for a big fellah like Raoul.  He was quite determined and was barely able to squeeze himself in, but he eventually did.  Once in, he really looked fantastic! Purring like mad, he tried to find the controls, but there were none.  Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!

It took lots of explaining on our part to convince Raoul that he had not purchased a real plane but merely a toy. He is quite disillusioned now. He mostly sleeps or sits and stares off into the far distance, a cat with shattered dreams.

Please don't let this happen to your cat!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Still using after 2 years I am just writing review because I am about to purchase couple more to sync up in my nano
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,My dog loves to chase things so a ball is a great toy for her. She is at the intense chewing phase so she likes that she can grab and chew this toy. She is around 3lbsz Kinda a flimsy so am not sure how much it will last when she grows up a little more. Do not recomend for bigger breads.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dog goes bonkers for these treats. She's used to pretty good treats. I only use them when I want a lot of focus from her. Actually these get her head in a tizzy and she sometimes loses her focus. They are almost too good.

The filets are a nice size and very clean to hold in your hand. I usually tear off little pieces because the whole filet would practically be a meal.

Be careful with these around dogs you don't know!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"These litter boxes help keep the litter we use in the box, even with two cats! The sides are high, but not too high that the cats mind."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I haven't tried them personally, but the dog is NUTS about em!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,dog loves them and the 3 pack is an excellent buy.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This was my third attempt to try and find a split leash for my two mini Aussies. It's light and very comfortable. It doesn't drag on the ground and the handle is cushioned which I wasn't expecting. Will buy from this retailer again when the need comes!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this as a second one for my dog because he loves it so much!  The price is
So much better than in the store.  They wash up wonderful."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is a good product. Durable. I wasn't able to find a suitable snack for it yet to have it fit perfectly, but my dog still likes to chase it and chew on it, and so far this is the only toy that wasn't destroyed in 1 day."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Dang, hate wasting money."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"All of my three cats prefer other toys with feathers.  With this one they just sit there wondering what the heck it is.  It's very small and actually looks more like a hairball than a mouse, or whatever it's supposed to look like."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I will be ordering more of this product. It is small enough to give to smaller dogs, (Jack Russells) but large enough to be more than a gobble."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"This cute toy has 3 squirrels in a tree stump, all filled toys, of course. My miniature Schnauzer enjoyed ""hunting"" the squirrels, but quickly figured out how to get them out of the various holes. He then proceeded to rip each one's tail off, then rip apart each squirrel, ""de-stuff"" them, and leave stuffing all over the floor. It's a cute toy, but no good for aggressive chewers!"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Perfect size for my growing pacman frog. He's only a few months old but he loves his new pool. Will likely fit fine as an adult, but we'll see"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Great toy. My cat plays with this toy all the time. He never tires of it.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"Two stars - the dog doesn't much care for it.

I normally buy only Natural Balance for my dog but I have to buy something different at times - he gets tired of the same old foods. He eats only soft/wet foods any more since he's 14yo and has had 5 teeth pulled in the past few years. I won't buy any more of this because I end up throwing half or more out."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Very good product.  I keep it in my refrigerator - it's very cool and soothing to my old dog's gums.  helps with brushing.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"The very first time I put my dog's food in this dish he ate a couple bites then grabbed the bottom edge of the bowl and flipped it over to eat the food off the floor. Then (because it did not occur to me to put the bowl on a high shelf) he very quickly chewed all the rubbery non-skid stuff off the bottom of the bowl. He is not really a problem chewer so I think something about this bowl is just too appealing for dogs to resist eating the whole thing. I was just stupid to consider a plastic bowl as safe for a dog, but the pet company who made it is absolutely irresponsible."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Oliver is a maniac for this thing. He's a triped and had a long tube thing, then we got this and he loves it even more. One end comes with a dangle toy attached but he ripped it off pretty quickly, I was able to sew it back on. One of the tubes is made from crinkle material which is awesome. Oliver loves to play in it, hang out in it, and take naps in it too. Great deal for this item. Cat games and toys cost 3-4 times as much in the pet stores."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,These are really not the items I was expecting.  They have bells in the them which I was not aware of and I worry about my dogs accidentally consuming the bell.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Great product. Love the wheels too. And PBA free. Important for our babies too.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We adopted my our Boston Terrier puppy at almost 9 months old and she came to us having ""not been trained"" which meant that she had trained herself to, among other things, pull pull pull on her leash. Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey! There's something over there I want to smell! [yank] Oh, right..."" Small dogs, large dogs, this is what you want!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,These are SOOOOOOOO Beautiful! I love these!!! I had the gold version before and they lasted about 3 years before the paint started chipping. These are not going to last a lifetime but that is okay -the price is right and they just beautiful.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I love koralia's and this one has lived up to all my expectations. The size is absolutely perfect, previous generations of the nano were significantly bigger which made them akward for nano and pico tanks.  This one fits in my salty fluval edge perfectly.  The only thing i'd like to note is that both the ""wet"" and ""dry"" magnets look exactly the same, i'm not sure if this was on purpose or not but it did distress me for a while when i was first setting it up and worried about possibly getting it wrong.  The manual states their different but mine looked exactly alike. besides that i say perfect pump."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This toy is great so long as you have hard surface floors for it. It won't work on rugs as it has little rubber ""feet"" that make it scamper around. My cats LOVE it. I had no issues using the two modes the instructions explained. It has auto turn off until the cat hits it and then it resumes the running around. The cats have had quite a few play sessions with it and the batteries are still okay."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Great idea! I'm still in the process of teaching my 6 month old schnoodles to use this to go out. They're still getting used to it but we use it every time we go outside.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,Good quality but even the large one is too small. My cat didn`t like it
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"Poorly designed handles. With them being in the middle, while holding the handles, whenever my pet would go to either side, the whole carrier would tip in that direction, making it hard to balance. Also, there are two hard, plastic ridges on the inside of the carrier that stick straight up that could poke or injure my pet if he were to step or fall on them."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I, more than my dog, love this.  Way too cute."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have six dogs and my nightly teeth brushing is a bit of a chore! One of my dogs is an Italian Greyhound with the WORST breath and oral issues! I've had his teeth cleaned a few times but because of other health issues that he has, I don't want to put him under anesthesia unless completely necessary. I now scrape his teeth weekly, use coconut oil and a sonicare toothbrush for brushing and Dentahex for his final rinse. His teeth look great and now his breath smells better then ever! I love this product and its great minty smell. It's all of my dogs favorite part of their nightly routine... not sure if its because they knows that it's the last step before I leave their mouth alone or that they love the taste? All of my dogs and I are fans! I'll be re-ordering again and again!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Fights the stubborn stink of deep eared Newfoundland dog ear funk. It is as good as the Vet supplies
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This was more of a little gift to my girlfriend than to the dog who would probably be happier without it.  It looks especially nice on our little fluffy white dog.  The bells produce a faint tinny sound that is barely audible.  Depending on your perspective, that may not be such a bad thing.  I'll give it 5 stars.  After all, what more could you reasonably expect?"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Hubby had no trouble at all figuring it out. The dogs never get tangled and the bonus is, 2 can go at a time, instead of just one!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Could not believe how wonderful this is. Well made and perfect for our baby Yorkie puppy. It's so easy to pop open and move around from place to place. We put it right next to the pool when we swim and our Molly LOVES watching us. Just ordered a second one to keep in the car all the time.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This stuff is AMAZING! I have a beloved oriental rug and a little dog that had an accident. I was terrified of using a cleaner that would ruin the handmade rug. I also needed to get the odor out. This stuff did it! It gently cleaned the rug and got the order out! Love it!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I researched a lot of ""food puzzels"" because our dog kept choking while eating an entire cup of food in a literal 10 seconds!  After hours of research I decided on this - I'm happy with my choice!  I don't have to babysit him like other interactive puzzles to make sure he doesn't eat and choke on the disconnecting pieces - this he can do alone and give me a few minutes to breathe!  We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a small Cavalier King Charles girl who LOVES to swim and fetch. This is the best water toy I've found so far.  Her mouth stays closed while fetching in the water allowing less water to be ingested. No coughing, snorting or water intoxication!

There are 2 floats making the duck visible to the dog in the water. It floats on top of the water, and there are plenty of places for the dog to grab the duck with her mouth. The orange beak has a squeaker. I would recommend this for any dog loves to fetch while swimming!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Great food, one of my favorites for my goldfish and other omnivorous fish. Works great on a clip, or just soak and dump in the tank. I have also found it works great in gel food for added nutrition and fiber."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I wrote a previous review and gave this five stars.  I did not know this chicken was from China.  What?  We have no organic chicken in the USA?

I encourage people considering this product to Google this product for information."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,The cats love this wand.  They like the Mylar sparkly ones better but the problem with them is I worry about them pulling out the streamers and they can choke on it.  This seems to be more sturdy.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered this dog snow coat in an XLarge after reading the comment and seeing the picture posted by Christina. I am so glad that I read her comment because I got the right size for my 10 pound Yorkie- the snow coat is made of very good quality materials and is put together very well. My little guy was so warm in it that he didn't want to come inside the house all he wanted to do was play in the snow and my dog doesn't like the cold weather at all but in this snow coat all he wanted to do was play because he was warm in it. If your dog is over 10 lbs. this coat is not going to fit him or her, but if your dog is under 10 lbs. I highly recommend buying this snow coat for him or her. ( if your dog is between 6 to 10 lbs. order it in an XLarge so it will fit him or her. I will post pictures for you all to see- I made the scarf for my little guy in the pictures"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Had these before in beige but when moving blew out of the back of my truck. So when I came back some one had already picked them up. My loss. So I bought them again but in the black. I have two big boxers and these are perfect height. The rims on the bowls are larger also so when they are eating the bowl is not moving. I would buy them again and again. Easy to clean. All one piece unit. No legs or moving parts. No surprises here. You won't be sorry. And I have a small kitchen with them back to back for more room.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is my back up filter in case of power outage. It is simple to hook-up simple to clean and yes very quiet and easy to operate. Just set it up hang on the side and your done. I guess if you have a small tank it will work fine. Remember always buy more than your minimal rating or you will be sorry. I hook this up to a battery inverter in the event of a power failure to at least keep my 100 gallon tank with some sort of filtration. This was an issue with Hurricane Irma. All my fish and corals survived and doing great.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,The seat cover works great and fit the backseat of our Hyundai Sante Fe just fine. The dogs love it and it is protecting our leather seat wonderfully.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,Returned it. Was way to small for my dog who only weighs 9 pounds. Had no body at all even with the straps to hold it up.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Prettier than the typical metal crates, which we were wanting since our dog sleeps indoors. However, I thought I'd be nice and let him have it outside one cooler day and he jumped on it and broke one of the bars. It still stands upright since there are other frame pieces holding it together. I like that we can lock the zipper quickly and easily."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is the first tower that my sister's cats have seen. I actually gave it to my BIL as part of his birthday. They have had to rearrange some of the shelves to try to preserve the toys but this has only made the cats more excited
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I don't have a problem with the product itself but it is packaged in a flimsy, unsealed, cardboard box and the small carbon flecks leak out of the packaging.

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Wheelchairs for dogs are a complex, complicated aid to use. An excellent instruction book to properly assemble the cart is required. In absence of an excellent instruction book, available customer service is necessary. When parts ""disappear"" from the assembled cart or break - customer service is necessary for parts replacement. There was no support in place for this complex product and we, sadly, were unable to attain much needed success for our old dog. Amazon made the return and refund very easy and for that, we're very grateful."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have had dogs for over 30 years and have used a wide variety of crates. I currently own the larger MidWest iCrate, a larger 'generic brand' crate, this size in 'generic brand', and an extra large all steel crate, along with many airline style travel crates.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"One of my dogs liked it, the other did not!  Seemed the best was the chicken & alternated with the beef!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I love lava lamps, but this is a terrible ""tank"" for a Betta. It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Longest lasting dog toys I have ever bought. Anywhere from days to weeks depending on how excited and determined the dogs get into pulling it apart.

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"Well , this product might be helpful for people with small pets but not for large. At least my dog ears are constantly dirty since he loves to lay on the dirt and that could be too much for these small pads. I thought this would help rather than keep on using Dab paper towel .

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"After using the lightweight Anti-Bark Dog Collar for two weeks, our 8# Maltese has almost learned that his random barking is unacceptable.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a 6lb Yorkie and the harness collars I have been using were such an unhappy experience for the dog and me, even the adjustable ones.  This is a wonderful collar for me and the dog.  I walk my dog twice a day on the capitol grounds, she pulls, runs, jumps and has a great time now...so do I.  No choking.  Love it.  I am buying another one.  I read the instructions from a review to measure right behind the front back legs up around chest with 2 fingers being comfortable able to go under the measuring tape.
I am measuring one inch smaller this time.  The one I received works fine.  But just one inch smaller will be perfect."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"This toy is insanely small. The opening was extremely small and I bought this for my tiny female rat and she couldn't even get half her body into this. Any bird that was given this as a toy would have to be very small because this toy is ridiculously small. So small I think a mouse might fit inside it, and that's a big... might fit inside it. Even if my rat had fit inside this, I wouldn't have let her have it because it's made so cheaply. A few bites in the right places and this entire thing would have fallen apart."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Herding dogs often love to push balls around with their noses, which helps satisfy their herding instinct if you don't have sheep. The ball needs to be too big for them to fit into their mouths, otherwise they might just pick it up instead of pushing it around, which isn't much fun.

Our Border Collie/ Australian Shepherd mix expends tons of energy running around pushing it all around the yard like crazy, frequently changing directions. Some days it is actually her primary form of exercise, she loves it so much.

It's a bit too big and hard for her to bite into, which is a good trait for a herding ball. Larger dogs could probably manage to bite into it."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Super cute and well made. I would buy from this dealer again.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"It appears to be a very nice collar.  I ordered a medium for my 11 lb. dog because I thought the small would be TOO small.  I was wrong.  The small may have worked better.  Hopefully I'll never have to know.  I'm not sure what breed my dog is (exactly) as he was a rescue but for anyone trying to figure out sizing I'll do my best to describe him so that you'll know weather to by a small or medium.  My dog has a long neck similar to a chihuahua with a wide head kind of like a boston terrier.  Like I said, the medium was too big."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,This was nice sized but unlike other kong toys is not durable at all.  My 50 lb wirehaired pointer destroyed it in 5 minutes.  The other kong stuffed animals have been awesome.  They still destroy them but it takes a while - like 3 weeks for that to happen.  I will stay with the real tough kong toys.  I don't recommend this toy to any dog that plays somewhat rough - it will not last.  Additional squeakers are a nice thought but they also present a hazard if they can be removed from the toy.  Overall not real impressed with this kong toy.

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,This heater does NOT have a thermal cutoff and will quickly overheat your water when it fails. I had 2 fail at the same time.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent product. It wraps around the dog, protecting the belly from splashes, and there is a hole on the top of the neck for the leash. And yes, the sizes run small. My 40lb golden retriever needed an XL."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,My cat will play for about 30 seconds and leaves it behind. I have to give it to a friend. She has a younger cat. Hopefully her cat likes this toy.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,A good product.  Not long lasting with our pup but she loves them.  Attractive price.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Our 9-year-old, 3# Yorkie and 65# Shepard mix love this new Science Diet canned dog food! We currently feed them a high quality, pure, grain-free dry and wet dog food, so purchasing a case of Science Diet on Amazon was still cheaper than buying from our vet or our local pet shop, and a good value for us.

Our Yorkie is usually a very picky eater and she didn't hesitate to wolf down this new Chicken and Veggie Science Diet dog food with great enthusiasm. We do mix this SD dog food with their $50 a bag Blue Wilderness dry food, so it lasts longer and provides them with all the nutrition they need to stay active and healthy. So far we haven't had any digestive issues and our dogs love it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Love Prime, this product makes water changes so easy and no worries about killing y fish."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dogs are 9-lb Chihuahuas, and they LOVE these Buddy Biscuits Soft & Chewy Peanut Butter treats! l like that they are soft and easy for my dogs to chew, and the size is perfect for small breed dogs. Because they are soft treats, my dogs don't leave a pile of crumbs on the floor after eating these treats! I usually give my dogs each a few of these treats right before heading out the door whenever I have to leave the house; because these are peanut butter flavor, my hand doesn't stink like meat right after reaching into the bag to give them to my dogs! Major plus in my book!

Overall, I definitely recommend the Buddy Biscuits Soft & Chewy Peanut Butter treats for anyone with small breed dogs or dogs that prefer chewy treats! Just don't forget to close the bag after giving some to your dog(s), or the treats will harden up!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I was looking for a ball my collie couldn't destroy (she tears apart everything and has a special obsession with balls). This ball seems well made, but it is very large and not pliable enough to where she can pick it up. She pushed it around the living room for the first afternoon, but then gave up and never touched it again. I ended up bringing it over to a friends house for his much larger retriever and even she could barely fit this in her mouth. I ordered the 6-inch diameter ball and I suspect this would be great for a big dog with a large mouth, but didn't work for my dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"It works just as described.  I was hesitant to get a shock collar for our puppy, but I was thrilled to see this option with the vibrate setting. It works great to reinforce our verbal commands.  It is great to say a command once, and get a response, versus yelling across the yard multiple times to get her attention.  It charges quickly.  The only issue I have had is that the collar will go in sleep mode and sometimes not respond to the remote. Not sure how this is happening as she is very active.  Took me a few times of it not responding to figure out what is going on."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My cat cannot get enough of this perch!  I can barely get it assembled each day without her hopping up immediately.  It is easy to move around from room to room, secure, has very soft and cozy surfaces on each level.  My cat is 10 lbs.

Easy to assemble, and suction cups are straight forward although for the top two (visibly different than the other four) make sure the surface is clean, as well as the suction cups themselves.  If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts. The suction cup itself, and then the little knob that screws in (once you have the strap in place).  The more you screw in the knob, the more air is compressed out of the suction cup, thus securing it even more. So screw that in tight."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"be mindful that they provide one tube, but ask you to cut it to provide the length required for two ports.  There was no point in the directions for it to tell you to cut to length for the first tube, when in fact, if you cut too long, it meant your outlet port is too short.  Shame on Fluval for cheapening out on this crucial piece for a 100+ dollar equipment."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have two bomb-dropping male cats. These boys seem to enjoy stinking up my office, which is the only place their litter box fits in my home. I prefer natural-everything but couldn't stand the terrible smell emitted from the litter box that stayed long after scooping. I've been using Tidy Cats clay litter which not only creates a lot of dust but tracks all over my damn house. On a whim, I decided to try this brand of pellets. What I've found is that the optimum freshness occurs when I pour about 2/3 of this product and then 1/3 of the tidy cats on top. The cats mix it together when they bury their treasure, and I haven't had ANY odor issues. I also don't have the excessive tracking anymore. I do agree with another reviewer that stated it would be difficult to see any blood in the cat stool, but that's a chance I'll have to take. Just ordered 3 more bags because at this price, it's a steal. Thanks Blue Buffalo."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dogs love these. Bought for my top porch and back yard. Very durable.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I'm sure these are great for some dogs, they just didn't work with my pup.  I'll just need to continue to pucker up and whistle as that is what he reacts to!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Bowl fell apart on second use. Top ring came completely off. Then second and third rings began to separate. We were traveling and needed the bowl for water and food, very disappointed!!
We have had other collapsible products before ( a funnel etc) that never did this."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Looks great with the matching Puppia harness and just like the harness, it seems very well made. Length is just about perfect for walking my cat or should I say for my cat to walk me."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is SO lightweight--it's a pleasure to lift. A friend tried this litter and found her cats walked around the house with it stuck to their feet. While all litter sticks to feet, this is light enough to make the trek much farther from the litter box.

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it. I don't see the purpose of spending the money on this--UNLESS you have trouble lifting the litter and it's either expensive (light) litter or no cat! THEN I say, this does the job, AND it's light! Keep your cat!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I am writing this for my two dogs. They say they really like them and want me to purchase more in future. They also like the fact that there is little chance that the chews will get stuck in their throats.

Is there anything else.........I guess not."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I've done my research on cavy food.  And from all that i have read, I know this is quality guinea pig food. I have a 7y/o piggie I rescued/adopted and she was always fed the junky kind of pellet food with all the colorful treats in it.  She became a big of a fatty. For awhile, I kept buying the same food for her b/c I knew that is what she was always fed and it was what she was used to.  Now that she's older, I really wanted to make sure she is getting quality food without all the junk treats.  and the verdict....She doesn't like it.  She won't hardly touch this stuff.  We've had it for a month, and she squeals at us, like we are not paying attention to her.  But I know this is the best food for her longevity.  So I will continue to feed it to her. She will get used to it. I would recommend this for your piggie if she is young and not tainted yet with the junky treat filled pellets."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is our first time trying these treats and I gave one to my dog and I turned around for a few seconds and it was completely gone, I thought maybe she lost it but I looked everywhere and it was gone.  Wow, she really loves these treats and I like the ingredients.  As far as her teeth being cleaner I didn't notice a difference but her breath smelled better then usual."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I own 4 Mini Schnauzers.  This doggy door has been a dream.  We installed it on the ground level of our basement door.  I am no longer a door man for my dogs.  Yah!  My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold.  This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.  That is OK with me.  Overall this doggy door gives me and the dogs so much more freedom to do our thing!  Yes I do love it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have two of these for my Dachshunds. Dachshunds can be hard to fit due to their super deep chest and tapered neck, but these harnesses fit great. The harnesses are durable, easy to clean (throw them in the washer), are made of good materials, and are expertly made. Very good quality."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Don't do anything, buy the large master kit and don't waste your money"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,We have 55 gallon fish tank filled with fish. I use this product weekly when cleaning the tank (gravel) we end up removing 25 percent of the water in the tank. Upon refilling the tank I pour the Tetra safe start directly into the tank with the handy measuring cap that is also the cover on the bottle.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,Don't bother buying this.  I purchased it to locate exactly the places my cat had sprayed so I could treat the correct places and this light did nothing!  Don't bother buying it.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Have tried quite a few harnesses for our cocker spaniel - our stubborn cocker spaniel. This makes it easy to walk her.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

I hope you find this review helpful and think if you just give Cat's Pride Fresh and Light a try you will never buy any other brand again!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,My dog hates it... it's too big to fit into the back of his mouth to get to his rear molars. He takes off running every time he sees it.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,GreT collar. If you have problems with your dog pulling you during your walk this will help
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"our cats are great jumpers, and this is great for getting them to jump."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is a Gorgeous tree!  My Zen room is done in a jungle theme and this tree fits decor beautifully.  My cat loves most of the tree, she won't go up on the top two levels or hammock/basket.  Try not to laugh, but I have to have the only cat afraid of heights. Super easy to put together, 20 minutes.  Seems very sturdy as well.  You would easily pay almost double at your local pet store.  Great cat tree, Great price!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My small dog loves this toy. He has not destroyed it, but the squeaker gave out quickly. He plays with it with great enthusiasm and seems to be happy ""jawing"" it as it does not squeak, but still makes a satisfying sound for my little dog. ~Mary B."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,This product is not safe for dogs.  It gives off sharp shards and is hard as a rock.  My dogs back teeth are ruined.  Not worth the risk ... find another safer chew.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,The cats new favorite food! They all went for this food and have had no issues with changing to this flavor.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I order these all the time, my fur babies love them, big bag for a good price!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We were happy with this random grab bag.  A few were some of the bengals favorites, a few they didn't care for, and a few somewhere in the middle.  Happy with this purchase for the $$"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a 12 year old Standard Poodle with some arthritis in her hips.  Most pain meds upset her stomach so I wanted an alternative, the PhyCox really does help her mobility and comfort.  I initially got them from the Vets office at twice the price I found on Amazon.  She gets 3 per day either with her breakfast or as a treat.  I can certainly recommend these."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"So. our cat's breath was not that great and we thought maybe he needed some dental treats (because honestly, no cat wants their teeth brushed by a person or some crap sprayed in the back of their throat) but Ghost the cat has a sensitive stomach and treats make him barf. On a whim, we decided maybe he would like these 2 dollar sticks that are NATURAL and good for chewing, teething, and oral hygiene. AND THE STICKS CAME IN TODAY. We gave him one to start out with so he doesn't get bored with a bunch of sticks at once. Well, he won't let it go except to play fetch. It's his new favorite thing ever. He loves it. He's going absolutely crazy. He only gets this way for feather toys and catnip sticks now apparently. GOOD BUY. Worth the money if you know how to keep cat toys interesting. Just play with your cat. (Try throwing the stick or waving it around."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,my dog loves it ... and its $6.00 less expensive here
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog is in LOVE with these and will dance around until she gets one a day too.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"Normally I feed my cats Fromm Four Star dry foods but I was looking for something a little more budget friendly available with Prime shipping that was still a better brand. With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This stuff works! I was finally able to walk without being constantly stopped or pulled. You can navigate the puppy by tugging non the less gently. My 4 month old puppy didn't like the feel of it. He tried his best to take it off of his nose. He usually gets super excited during walks but was a bit annoyed when he had this on. Im going to try and get him to like the collar. I only have walked him once. Will update with how I got him to like it. This is a wonderful wonderful product.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Our rat terrier loves chicken and she eats the grilled chicken every evening.  I'm picky about her food because she's diabetic, but she's eaten this food for several years and seems to be doing fine on it.  It's conveniently packaged, too."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Best poop bags I have ever purchased. I will never buy another kind.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is an AWESOME harness.  My senior Doberman fits perfectly in the XL.  It is comfortable and provides excellent control when walking because the leash attaches over the back instead of at the neck.  The padding is thick and soft.  all of the straps are adjustable going to the center line on his back and for the neck.  Goes on over his large head with ease then can be tightened if needed.  Best harness I've ever had, Roman is a happy dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dog loves this toy - this is her second one. She treats it like her baby and carries it around the house in her mouth. The first one is still fine after almost 2 years, I just bought a second one for travel."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Because I started using a paper pellet litter, I purchased this scoop due to the wider holes and it is great. I especially appreciate the ability to hang the scoop on the side of the box."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I received a free item to review.

The sounds are loud and remind me of (if you can fathom this) a raspy-throated human infant processed through a vocoder synth. Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.

She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.

It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!)."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Love the size. Very easy to open and I love that it came with a scooper.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,Wood chips/curls are sharp and poke through the covering.  Had to pick them out only to find more kept working their way to the surface.  Dog wasn't able to use in this condition.  Made in China.... Stuffing was brittle and course.  Ended up emptying out stuffing and filling with store purchased fiber-fill.  Very expensive project.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Well priced and well made-- I want to get another one son-- gt this one for a puppy customer.  Would buy again.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My rabbit loves this. He uses it two ways, to sleep in and to set on top."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable. For now I will keep looking for a similar product but with better workmanship. Fail."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Like these Hamilton Collars and the way they stand up to my very active dog.  My Viszla is just under 50 lbs but he thinks he is bigger.  He has always been a puller and these collars seem to withstand that. They don't fray.  I got this one to replace old one because of eyelets - only because he had been hunting and the collar had gotten wet a lot and taken on and off quite a few times. Other brands eyelets fall off after a week or two.  So far everything is great on this one!
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Don't we all just want to love poop bags lol. They are poop bags and hold the poo just like they were supposed to. the holder isn't so bad either.
If they picked up the poo for me I'd give 'em 5 stars."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"my rats are picky eaters but LOVED this food.
I would say it's a healthy alternative to mixes, as they present the chance for your pet to pick and choose, thus incurring into some possible non balanced nutritional patterns.
If you're looking for something that your pet will devour while making a healthy choice, go for it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is very well made and supportive. Fits my 8 week old 5 lb. frenchie in a small and I bought a medium for the future.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,I am happy with this purchase. It is longer than I need for my cage so I cut it in half and saved one half for later. My bunny seems to like it and has now begun to chew on it. Overall I would purchase again
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My dogs love these treats, but I can't understand the HUGE price increase over the last few months.  I used to buy these on Prime for $21.99 for 6 boxes.  I can understand a small increase, but nearly $12?  Why?"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Orijen makes the best food/treats for dogs. If my dog is going to eat it I need to trust where it's coming from and I do when it's champion. These treats are great, not very big but they pack a punch of nutrition and the dogs go crazy for them. All the flavors are great but if your pet is sensitive to a certain protein there is a flavor for you so feed with confidence."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Our little dog became ill recently, and the vet could not figure out what happened. We decided to clean up her diet and get anything made with propylene glycol out of her treats, and we knew we wanted to buy treats made in the US.  These fit the bill.  She enjoys them, although she won't always eat them. She's a tad picky. I'm impressed with the ingredients list, which is short. I will try the chicken next to see if she favors those more."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"We have 4 cats. They have all been spayed and/or neutered. One male still sprayed somewhat. We tried the Feliway spray. I'm still trying it out to see is it has any effect, however the plug in units are wonderful and work exceptionally well.  ."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is a really good brush. I like the way it retracts and the hair just wipes off of it. I have a Golden Retriever that sheds a lot. It works great.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,My kitten pretty much ignores it. I know catnip doesn't affect cats til they are older so I will just reintroduce the toy to her when she is grown.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I just received this so we are on day one, but so far my dog LOVES it. He hasn't been interested in any non-edible chew toy I've given him but he is absolutely loving this."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,These are very well made and a perfect larger bug size.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"It did not work for the 2 cats I bought it for, didn't seems to effect them at all."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT. HAD TO CUT UP INTO SMALLER PIECES. BOTH MY CATS LOVED THE VEGGIES IN THE FOOD AND THE VARIETY,"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My cat meow'd with praises over these PureBItes Chicken Cat treats. They are straight up chicken and made in the USA! Okay, so she doesn't care about those things, but I do. The fact that she loves them makes me happy. They are soft and easy to eat, making them the perfect snack for when she's in between meals. I used to purchase them along with canned food from another vendor, but by the time they reached my apartment I was left with chicken dust. It didn't go to waste, but I do appreciate these being on Amazon so I can purchase these by themselves if I need to and they don't get crushed by other heavy items."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Does it's job....which is saying a lot.  My cat goes outside a lot and picks up fleas all the time.  When I put this on her I NEVER have a problem with her bringing fleas into the house. She's never had a reaction to it, except when she licked it (I guess I didn't put it high enough on her shoulders)...she yelled for 30 min :( Anyway, worth the price and will buy again!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"As described! My Labradoodle loves this brush. Well made, fits in the hand and the overall structure of the brush, makes grooming easy."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"These filters work great in my Emperor 400 system......Also Lasership  has rocket speed shipping hat's off to them!

Keep up the awesome work Lasership and Amazon job well done!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Great harness - exactly what we needed to reign in an energetic doxie mix!  Easy to fit to her size, and it works perfectly to have a textbook walk with our little girl!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"They changed the packaging and name. My dog is super picky, even with treats. He loves his vitamins!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Very tough and seems to be comfortable. I have a 65lb pit and it works very well for him!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Simply the best, but pricey. Easy clean, no chemicals, no smell if you are diligent cleaning."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog LOVES it!!  I even give it to him as a little treat and at night put it one a little piece of Greenie so that's the last thing he eats at night.  I would definitely recommend this product.  An easy way of getting a little extra cleaning in during the day.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Does a good job of removing small animal urine from the cage and hamster ball. I does not leave any residue and the smell goes away once you wipe it off. The bottle last us 4-5 months with us cleaning three cages weekly.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,Would love this product if it came with a roof. My dog very quickly learned that she could climb it - and climb it she did. Wouldn't hold her for more than 5 minutes (but still a lot sturdier than the canvas pen that I purchased)
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"This is easy to put together and nice looking, for a cat drinking fountain.  But the motor is noisy--could hear it over the TV in the next room--and our cats were not interested in it at all.  Sent it back."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,WE have two and we absolutely love them. I have another friend who Foster baby kittens and she had me order one for her.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This toy exceeded my expectations.  It's great to add some kibble and some smaller treats.  My pup rolls it around with his notes and sometimes bats at it with his paws.  It keeps him busy for several minutes.  Cleaning is easy as it folds inside out.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,clippers are great for dogs!! I have two dogs and these clippers are wonderful! Worth the money! The are quite enough to not bother my dog.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Looks like it will work! This is the best price I've found.  Hoping our pup learns to love it.  In way better condition that the one we purchased at P###m##t (which had some bent sections and costs more).
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog loves them. Honestly I'm not sure how effective they are but I like to believe they help
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Dried meat is safe but I am questioning why they are not sanitized first and if the urine is allowed to stay in/on them, wouldn't the harbor bacteria?"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Doggy toys, just make sure you remove the electronic part with the battery before they swallow it. That is if your dog is a chew monster like mine. This is a good rule for all dog toys with batteries or electronics."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,Birds like it but these are not neat stalks of millet.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dogs love these and the best part is they last forever! This is the one toy they can't chew up. It keeps them busy for hours!
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I bought myself 2 and 1 as gift.  I LOVE that they are ""real glass""  Really cant get better for $$$  The ""Chain"" Pet Stores more expensive!!  These were packed REALLY well.  I LOVE!!!  BTW: Do NOT put more than 3 or 4 guppies and 4 shrimp in this aquarium.  You just CANT if you want happy environment."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I have a Rottweiler we are treating for heartworm. We are having to keep a high energy dog calm 24/7 and this seems to be having the most impact.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Good product but my dogs don't seem that interested in chewing on it. They seem to like the Bionic toys better.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This 300W heater is about 1/3 the price of a similar heater at my local fish store.  I would highly recommend it as it is doing an excellent job of keeping my aquarium at the desired temperature.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great filter. I had one of these in a previous tank, which is why I ordered this one. It is quiet and easy to clean. It is also very easy to assemble. I recommend It."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I got this for a crate pad but ended up using it as a play mat for my puppy. She loves it; it is sort of like her home base in the house. She plays on it, sleeps on it, chews on it, etc. It is her little place. Will use it for a crate pad as she gets bigger but it is perfect for a play mat now."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Finally a cone our dog could eat with, sleep on, and not damage the entire house running into things in!
Did give him a light snore when it was too inflated, but hey, that's just our dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Was using another product, but fleas seemed immune to it. This works good on my German shepherd"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is the only rawhide that doesn't give my dog diarrhea.  He loves them even though he is a medium size Sheltie. Carries it everywhere with him.  Hope I can always get them for him!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dog is very skiddish and usually doesn't let me get close to her face, but I'm actually able to clean her teeth with this product. Easy to just rinse off while cleaning. Very happy with this product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"More than enough air for a 10 gallon.  I'm using it to power an air driven, in-aquarium box filter and am using the included regulator valve to limit the amount of air.
And it's quiet."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,my cat loves these treats. he is really happy. These are the best cat treats ever invented for pet owners
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Y'all. This cat litter. It's awesome. I was having issues with every litter we tried because it just STUNK. Even when it was fresh and just poured, the fragrance was absolutely horrendous. It just made cat poop smell poopier, if that's even possible. I'd gag every time I'd walk by. I took a chance and bought this, based on the other reviews and being ""fragrance free"". I am more than happy to say, it truly is. I can't even tell we have a cat. There's zero smell. Zero. Even when it needs to be cleaned. Zero. If that's what you're looking for, get this."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Been giving this vitamin to both our dogs every day for years. Dogs like the flavor. Pet-tabs were first recommended by our vet years ago. Price much better through Amazon
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Got these to give to my 8 mth old chihuahua who was diagnosed with elbow dysplasia.  She was limping for a short while but after taking these supplements for last few weeks the limp is less and less noticeable.  I've given my other chihuahua a 1/2 dose every day as well for preventative care.  They eat them up like treats and love them.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I based my size choice on feedback I'd seen about this product, but it's too small. I'd love to be able to send it back for an exchange, but it may be cost prohibitive to do so."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,it can be dangerous if the dog runs it can snap. use caution when using this kind of leash.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"These bags are much larger than I expected them to be.  It's been a while since I've purchased some, but I don't recall them being so big. They do the job! Makes picking up the pup's messes a lot easier, and a whole lot more sanitary. Especially for my elderly father.  He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness. Some I've purchased in the past were a little thinner than these. If you have a pooch you need to pick up after, these are great to have on hand. They do have a slight odor, but I think it's just the plastic itself. It's not terrible, but is noticeable upon opening the box. They aren't scented with perfume, thank goodness!  I was able to purchase these bags at a discount, not free, for testing and review. Regardless of price paid, it has no bearing on my actual opinion of the product. I rate 1-5, and rate 5 when I would purchase again."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cat DC was way overweight so we put her on Purina one Salmon and Tuna flavor. She is losing weight and more active than she was eating Seafood sensations and Fancy Feast Gravy lovers. She is getting used to it and seems to like it ok
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Love this!  I put my tortoises in it out in the sunroom.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Who cares what I think? Our cat LOVES this stuff! So much so it's hard to believe it's just freeze-dried chicken. But apparently it is. Now our cat comes running whenever he hears the rustling of a plastic bag. Not sure if that's a good thing, but the cat seems happy : )"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these for cats, even though they say dog bow tie. The adjustable strap is too large for even my chubbiest kitty, but I just tied them."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I was curious as to how well these balls would hold up.  I have a large German shepherd who is an aggressive chewer.  After he destroyed the first ball after chewing on it for 15 minutes, he has learned to be more gentle of his chewing with them (Note: these balls are tougher then a regular tennis ball, with the added bonus of a squeaky noise when chewed on or squeezed.)  They do seem to be the same size as regular tennis balls.  My boys are very happy with these balls, and I am hoping they will hold up at least for a month.  I think next time I will buy the larger size balls though."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My cat loves to play with these balls.  I must've gone through a dozen of them because they always get lost in my apartment, or my cat chews them out.  These balls are incredibly light, making it super fun for my cat to chase and bounce around the floor."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My vet recommended this collar, and also sells them.  My boy cat had suddenly become extremely aggressive with one of my other cats, and was actually viciously attacking her.  The two cats are now separated, but I do believe this collar had an amazing calming effect on him as he seems much happier and not so grouchy.  I spent quite a bit of money on the pheromone diffusers before trying the collar, and I do feel this collar works much better."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I use this for my lidded litter box. It already has a charcoal filter on top, but I noticed an odor towards the end of the day when my kitty's droppings have been sitting there a while. Not surprising since the litter box is completely enclosed, so it keeps all odor inside the box. I added one magic pad instead of 2 since it was to supplement the big filter it already had, and it's good for about a month. My kitty is happy, and so am I."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great, our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased a purple harness for my shih-poo and he loves it!!
It is gentle on his chest and whenever he wants to run, you softly pull him back and it does not chock him like a collar. It was good quality and awesome color selections!"

This Nature's Miracle Jaw Scoop helps you keep a clean yard without too much bending over and eliminates having to get your hands any where near dog feces! I am a tall person so I wish it was a bit longer, but a short person may not even have to bend over. I like the fact that it is all plastic so you can easily spray it off and keep it clean. I have had it out in the yard with our bucket for a while and have not had issues with it rusting or anything because it is almost all plastic. I wish that they also sold a bucket or something, but a nice 5 gallon bucket with a garbage bad in it works fine. That way you can dump the load while you walk around instead of having to walk all the way to the trash. Price was like double in the pet store than it is on here so its definitely a great price!

~Thanx~"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I ordered an XS for my 15  pound Maltipoo with a 20 inch girth.  Fit perfectly and is lightweight for the Florida heat.  No questions are ever asked by vendors about the authenticity of  my service dog.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Way back, you used to need a prescription, then it was over the counter yet still pricey. Well on Amazon you can get flea and tick protection much cheaper. However if you have long haired dogs such as German Shepherds, Huskies, etc topical flea treatments may not work well for you. I use this on my Jack Russells and haven't seen a single flea or tick and been using it for years. When I used it on my Huskies though I don't think it was able to get down to the skin well and I still saw fleas/ticks, so I use Trifexis for them, an oral flea preventative. I'll keep buying this from Amazon. It is definitely the real product, no knock off or imitation. Looks exactly the same as when I buy it at the vet's office."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Unfortunately, my 5 cats only found them fun for about 5 minutes.  I now put them in a bag with some Kong catnip and bring new ones out about once a week for something different.  They have lasted a good while, but they don't play with them much once the catnip smell is gone."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have 2 boxers that I felt needed a little warming at night, even though they sleep in the house.  The fit is true to size and the length is appropriately long.  Washes well and my dogs don't mind them."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Your 4-legged buddy may never come near you again, but it really is adorable! Well made..."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,If you want a aquarium heater. These are the best. I have 6x tanks all have two heaters. One primary and one secondary. I have had to replace one bad heater in 5 years. The average. 1 in 12 heaters will fail In 5 years.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I don't think she can chew this one up! That's a good thing!
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,Nothing is wrong with the product but my dog didn't like it
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"EXACTLY WHAT I USE AND YES I WILL REORDER AGAIN.....ORDERED IT AGAIN, CAN'T BE ANY EASIER....AND FAST SERVICED AT A GREAT PRICE....JUST BROUGHT IT AGAIN AND THANKS AGAIN...."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Bought this for my baby rescue squirrel. He loves it. I can always find him curled up asleep right next to it. It has also been washed and dried several times and is still holding up.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I give this to Chase every morning. He is healthy happy and the vet says he looks good!
Dr Mercolas products are great!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,a bit difficult to put on.. the dog fights it back
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"Turns into saw dust when wet, then becomes impossible to scoop. You have to just dump out all out."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have an extremely heavy chewer that destroys any toy quickly.  He's making a small dent in it but overall lasting leaps and bounds longer than any other...and he loves it and he has perfectly white teeth!!!!  He hated nylabones and others like it.  Warning:  After a few minutes of chewing, it gets tiny sharp edges all over that hurts to step on.  Also, don't let it drop on your foot.  It feels like concrete."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Soooooo adorable!! My puppy looks so cute!!! Very nice product!! Came all wrapped up nice and FAST customer service!!! I will purchase more!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dogs love these little treats, what more can I say?  It past the dog tasting test."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is great for cats that are having trouble keeping weight on, or are ill.  It has been very useful."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,My puppy did not care for these much but my older dog ate it in one seating. Approx 10 minutes to devour for the 13 year old Sheltie. I would not purchase again.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,It's only April my cat stay in the house but it seems to be working they didn't have any fleas and they still don't have any fleas will update in the summer
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dogs were having some serious skin and coat issues, even on high-quality, grain-free dog food. I did an elimination diet with them and found out they're both sensitive to chicken. I switched them to the sweet potato and fish formula and now they both have shiny coats with no flaky skin, and they've stopped chewing the fur on their paws. They are both at a healthy weight, too, which is unusual for older small dogs. I highly recommend this food!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond."
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,The concept was nice but was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used. It is a fleece like material but is basically threadbare. The cats are basically laying on particle board. Had they used just a little thicker/softer material I would have given this 5 stars. I would not purchase again.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I am very pleased with this aquarium. First of all it is beautiful. It has become the centerpiece of my living room. Second, I really like the dimensions. It is long like a 10 gallon but thin giving it the illusion of being a larger tank and giving my fish room to really swim. I have a betta, a snail and a few shrimp and they are all doing very well"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Cats ask for it. They balk at other brands because this is all they are used to.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,This little bed is great for when my little guys want to be warm and snugly!  Great for both cats and small dogs!
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"The usual problem with reviewing cat toys is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cats as a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat does not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture.

Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owners or their pets will have much use for it.

First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cats and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cats will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this as furniture.

As a scratching post (and also as a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, as it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching posts that move around as they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for.

My cat tried this once as a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor as she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and has not returned to it since.

Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designers of this product ignored these axioms and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is.

Two stars, because your cat might like it as a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily."
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I love the material & the design; however, the belt clip doesn't hold firmly enough.  Bend over & it pops off easily.  I really wanted to love this.  Sadly, it will probably sit on the shelf."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This brand of pet food is great. All good ingredients.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Had this in the back of a Nuvo Fusion 20 and it worked well. I've moved it over to a 65 gallon where it's now solely running Phosguard and I'm still very happy with it. It's a great, small media reactor."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Easy to setup and works great! Im using it in my Coralife 32g bio cube
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Great cover. Thick canvas material that covers seat well. Bought this to protect the leather middle seats in my 2014 Honda van. Has held up well to my 140lb service dog and my leather seats look like new when I take it off. Even stands up to wet feet..when I checked to see if dampness had soaked through I was please to find that my leather seats were dry and none of the moisture had soaked through to the underside of the pet cover. Going to buy another one for my daughters car.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cat loves this and likes to bat it around.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I have ordered quite a few different scratchers  over the years but I have to say  this one was a winner.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Tested it against a glass floated version and it was very close to temperature. Another bonus is, you can rearrange-move it as needed. I use this on both of my tanks. Even if one degree off in either way, it's more important that you keep the temperature consistent when changing your water. Good-quality product."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Puppies enjoy chewing on this toy and it is durable
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I cannot live without this product. I can not express how much I love love love this shampoo. Smells amazing and leaves my pups super smooth and shiny! Highly recommend!!!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My pup had a very dry nose. I purchased this and was amazed at how well it moisturized his nose. By day two, his nose looked normal again. By far this is the best product I have used. I tried things already in my cabinet, but nothing worked the way this did. And yes, he loved the taste, so I had to make sure I fed him, immediately after applying the ointment, to prevent him licking it off."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My bunny basically litter trained herself. All I did was sit this in her cage, put her hay rack directly above it and her food bowl in the corner of the pan. Super easy to clean. Love that my girl isn't sitting in her urine and feces."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my shephard mix. Perfect size for her. At first she was skeptical about going in it, but now she absolutely loves it. It is her ""room"" and one can tell she feels absolutely comfortable in it. Easy to assemble, the double door is great because you can set it up however you want at home, and it even has a divider that comes in handy when potty training."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,When Baruch mini-poodle is bored I put this on the floor. He is happily occupied. Poor friend. He wants to be able to put them back in himself. So I help out and put them in myself. We live on the third floor of a condo.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"the kitties love the friskies and i love having it delivered to my door. yee haw,  it came to the door, i unpacked it and fed the cat pak. full bellies = afternoon nap."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Bought it for traveling outside the home but the cat likes it so much that she naps in it during the day.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog just loves these. I have tried other brands and she turns away.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have 4 cats, so I can't afford to splurge on their food.  And sometimes they don't all like one product, and that doesn't work for me.  This kibble is liked by all 4 cats and seems more healthful than some of the less expensive brands.  Good luck pleasing your cats!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is a very nice pet bed.  I bought it for my 10lb chihuahua and she just loves it.  She loves playing in it.
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Although when I received the product all the pre-drilled holes weren't there, the company was prompt with response and everything was settled. Assembly by myself only took 15 minutes, very easy to build and very easy to clean! I do recommend if people have a severe allergy to wood they not get this. I opened the box and immediately had a asthma attack! But it is very nice and sturdy, has two decent size levels. I have to female rabbits that live in it and they are more then comfortable in it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,I was extremely disappointed in this product. I purchased it for my rabbit. I was expecting it to be the size of a small coke can. It's the size of a large pencil. Definitely not worth the money. I hope Kaytee is able to recommend this to mice and hamsters as it's even too small for a guinea pig.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"These are great soft joint chews. I started giving them to my porkie Bennie before his knee surgery, torn ACL and sublixating patella. Small dogs are prone to knee problems. Bennie had his knee surgery and healed faster than expected. He was jumping 3 weeks after his surgery. His vet after 6 weeks gave him the all clear for duty. I know the Cosequin helped him tremendously and will continue to give them to him. I started giving them to my 13 yo cockapoo."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My dog eats these like a treat. Only time will tell if giving these are worth it. She is young but I read that it doesn't hurt to start when young so have no idea if this is working or not. But, will continue to give to her. No harm and maybe something to gain."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Every batch has been great.  It even smells awesome
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Our Weimaraner was having some trouble with urine leakage.  She wasn't an older dog and occasionally she would urinate while sleeping.  We wanted to try a more holistic approach.  She did not have an infection.  We discovered it was not all that uncommon for female dogs to develp some urinary tract and bladder weaknesses after they are spayed.

We noticed a change in her in about three weeks.  She stopped having accidents and leaks.  She loves to chew the tablets.  They are liver flavored so she thinks they are a treat. When she ran out of them for a few weeks, we noticed she started to have some leakage problems again, so we put her back on the product and so far no problems.  We saw no side effects either."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"OK, did the research and bought this invisible-type-fence. Followed the easy-to-understand directions, charged and put the collars on, and did a little bit of training, not all that much really.  Dogs (2) stay within their boundary, end of story.  No headaches, no grief, it just plain works.  Dogs now don't wear collars, except maybe once a month for a couple days as reminders."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,The brushes themselves are a little long but they work great.
Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"This works a little better than most clumping litters, but it still tracks and doesn't do as good a job as Cedarific to fight odor. It is very expensive to pay $18 to barely fill two litter boxes; won't purchase in the future."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Another fun product for my bird to play with. He really likes the bell on the end and he's drawn to the colorful spheres.
The reason I took a star off is that the area where the hook connects to the top sphere is very loose. The whole toy pops off of the hook frequently with very little pulling, sometimes they fall off just trying to hang it in the cage.
In the end the bird still plays with it and he enjoys it, so it's not a super big deal.
Overall, a fun toy for my cockatiel, even if it doesn't stay connected to the hook."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Our dog loves this dog food. This is an awesome grain free dog food. I used the cat food for years and when we got a dog switched her over to this as well and she seems to love it.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,My puppy seems to enjoy these as a good puppy teething treat. I am pleased also.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My cats favorite canned food. I do not know healthy this is, but it is the only canned food my picky eatters will touch. I have a fifteen year old cat that has been eating this for years so it must not be too bad. She is still as healthy as could be."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Mr. little 8 month old female puppy loves this toy best of all.  It's unique ""oh noooo"" sound is activated by pushing a spot on the tummy area and whenever she hears that she comes running ready to play.  A couple of times lately she has accidentally made its ""voice"" go off too which she seemed to like also.  It's good to throw holding by one arm so it does ""cartwheels"".  I have two dogs actually, both under 10 pounds, and sometimes the two of them both grab and arm and play tug of war after I throw it which is fun too.  It's holding up very well but nonetheless I'm getting another because she likes it so much and I don't want to be left empty-handed if the other one quits working or if it just gets too dirty.  Me and my two dogs give it a definite thumbs up."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"So there is a reason this food is a #1 best seller in dry dog food. It's not just because of the price for the size bag but it's the taste and scent the dogs go crazy for. Diamond pet foods had one bad recall a few gets back and everyone wants to judge them based on that. Doesn't just about everything everywhere get a recall at some point in its life span? My chocolate lab Bruce wasn't eating Wild Calling! And Natures Variety Instinct gave him the worst soft stool ever. I ordered this on Prime Now and it came to my doorstep in just under an hour. From the moment his food arrived Bruce was going crazy for the bag. Now he whines for his food before breakfast & dinner. He just can't get enough of the taste. Do yourselves all a favor and if your reading this review, BUY THIS GREAT PRODUCT FOR YOIR BEST FRIEND :)"
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Bought these on prime day.  My dog is 4 yo, 80lbs, eats a high protein, grain free food, and has never been sick in his life. Gave him one a day since received them. Woke up to him pacing,  rubbing his head all over ground,  vomiting blood, stool on hardwood (never had accident inside in years). Blood in stool. Vomiting and neurological symptoms through day.  Took him to emerg vet. Whole body bright red,  blood in ears. $800 later... and a night of iv fluids, IV antibiotics,  anti diarrhea, pain meds... and labs showing liver enzymes off the charts...  it appears I've fallen victim to poison dog treats. Will be taking further measures.  Beware."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This is a great mixture of flavors for a dog.  My dog absolutely loves these.  I have several brands of treats here right now but she loves these best of all of them.  They are soft bites yet they are larger and a little thicker than some of the other brands.  I'm haapy with the ingredients and they don;t upset her stomach which is what I like best.  Very happy with these.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Escape Artist Australian Kelpie- Meet your match. I don't recommend starting the shocker level to be set at 100, I tried it and it is very painful, but I am getting great results at around 15-25. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to those who have tried ALL other options and their dog still escapes, doesn't listen, ect. Always remember that there are other settings that should be used in training, like the beeping and vibration. My dog picks it up very quickly. I have only had to use the shocker twice before he learned not to take off out of the yard (and down the road). Fast shipping! Thank you!!!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Lola really likes vegetables and this is her all time favorite. She dances around when we open it.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My problem- I didn't check the dimensions. Smaller than I expected and wanted but as described-kinda. The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats. The outside pouch will not hold a tennis ball , for the size it will hold, that size is small enough to choke your dog. It does have an inside pocket about the size of a clicker. When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done. So, if you have a small dog with a small ball, tiny poop bag(s), and tiny treats then this bag is great for you! My dog is a 100lb Wht. G. Shep who likes to fetch a baseball bat and tennis balls. Oh well, my error not Amazon or the seller(description a bit misleading)...I have used the treat bag now and find it great for a lot of smaller treats for my dog and probably better and less costly than the larger treats he was getting. He doesn't care since I break the larger treats to smaller bites. The ball pocket..nah..use it for a bag or clicker. I like this purchase!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog loves these and they are much less expensive than buying them at the veterinarians

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I bought this in the small size for my son's gerbils. Although they fit on it fine, and it seemed to spin smoothly and silently when I spun it with my fingers, they could never figure out how to get it moving. Even with a full-size gerbil standing on it, it wouldn't move unless they were right on the edge. They ended up chewing the whole thing up before they ever figured out how to use it."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"These are nice clippers. I'm not a professional, but shave my dog down regularly, and have tried  a number of different products. These clippers are fine, and they work nicely. What I'm not so sure about is the price. I'd suggest two other options:

For professional use, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oster-A5-Turbo-2-Speed-Professional-Animal-Clipper/dp/B000LRN31A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper</a>&nbsp;has been the gold standard for grooming professionals for decades. And since it sells for less than these, I'd select that first for professional usage.

For home use, I don't really notice any difference between this one and my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andis-EasyClip-Pro-Animal-7-Piece-Detachable-Blade-Clipper-Kit-Pet-Grooming-MBG-2-22690/dp/B00UT3F31O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andis EasyClip Pro-Animal 7-Piece Detachable Blade Clipper Kit, Pet Grooming, MBG-2 (22690)</a>. It works exactly the same, and also feels like a high quality clipper (way better than the cheap Wahl human/home clippers I have). It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4). If you want to use combs with this one, you'll pay more for something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Stainless-Steel-Guide-Combs-3390-100/dp/B002RBWL1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wahl Professional Animal Stainless Steel Guide Combs #3390-100</a>, which I'm sure is nice... but it's not included.

Also, note that there are two difference blade sizes for Wahl clippers. The ones designed for animal usage have longer combs which do not fit the cheaper (and not awesome) home Wahl clippers that many people may have. The animal ones are interchangeable with Andis (I used my Andis combs on this one for testing).

Anyway, this is a good clipper... but wouldn't be my first choice for the price."

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written.

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a cliff hanger, so be warned of you really don't like that. I usually don't mind, but I kind of did with this one. Shortly after beginning the book, I knew she wasn't going to may the guy she was dating, but I thought she would marry another character in the book. That didn't happen, although I suspect she will in another book. One thing I really didn't like was at the end it announced that the guy she dated for most of the book was engaged, but it didn't day to whom (although I'm pretty sure whom). Still, it was a very enjoyable read. The characters were very likeable & the book was very clean."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,The story continued well written and had me enthralled from the get go.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to! This author has yet to disappoint me but this is some of her best!"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The book was so, so good. I couldn't put it down because I definitely wanted to find out how this story was going to play out.  Talk about the sexy banter between Amber and Lance...so, good!  Lance mouth was just so deliciously sexy, off the chain.  Amber says ""You're not coming over"" Lance says ""I will be there and we both will be coming later""......Daym that was Hot!!  He can sneak in my bedroom at my parents house anytime!  The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ms. Hamilton continues to raise the bar in her latest, book 2 of the Highland Gardens time travel highland romance series, that is believable and history rich. It is filled with intrigue, finding love, and commitment to family. Finn is a high-powered modern rich man who longs for true love and a family like his cousin Laurie. He character is developed in such a matter that one has empathy and understanding that money and hotness doesnt always bring you happiness but more often loneliness and uncertainty as to who are your true friends and what true love is. Wow I love Elspeth, she is a strong woman but due to the era she was born and family duty puts love before family. Her character is truly thought provoking and though you want to scream don't take that from your fianc&eacute; we truly understand what the mens beliefs about women were back then compared to today. From my viewpoint there weren't any strong secondary characters but Caitrina and Douglas seemed to deserve a story.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Loved this story. It was hard to put the book down.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process. Read this guy; if you like raunchy, sexy, a little crazy and a fabulous story."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Why did Mattie want to be Englisch???  This wonderful story answers the question.  Mattie's need to get away was so painful for her.  She seemed to be rebellious because how her father treated her.  Why did he treat her that way?  I believe he was authoritarian with out the hand of love.  How hurtful the story is and Mattie's leaving causes much pain.  Does Mattie get her happy ever after???  Does she find herself???  Will she succeed in the Englischer world???  You need to read this story to find out.  I loved it and found it an eye opening read regarding rebellion.  Highly recommend this story.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

A nice collection with some great authors, perfect to pass some time.

(I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review)"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I was given an ARC for an honest opinion With that being said, this is a sequel and reading book 1 is a must! This book picks up right where book 1 ended. Rose has been kidnapped and taken to Hell, she is being held by Razor at Basiliuss command. Of course, we know Rose isn't going to take this lying down. With the help of friends, both old a new, a rescue mission has launched.
I won't be giving away any spoilers, but we do get to add more pieces to the puzzle that is Rose.

I love all of AK Michaels works. They are always full of the most interesting people/species. The writing is always good and the story is nonstop from beginning to end.  If you love Witches, Vampires, Demons, Gods, Wolves and Fairies this is a must read. Definitely another 5 star read for me!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first book of Mrs. Montgomery that I've read, and I'm glad I did.  The premise of a colony ship having to settle the wrong planet, and how their society dealt with that was an interesting one.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoy the Sole regret books , but not as much as the Sinners. But in fairness I don't Olivia set out to give us as much depth with the SR guys, but I think she is changing her mind. I really felt like we got into Kellen's head in this book, and I really did enjoy it ,but I did miss the nasty sex that I have to to expect from the SR guys.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've read a couple of books on dog training, and I have to say, this is by far the best one I've read.
I have two dogs, and I am having problems training them, but with the help of this book, I'm sure I'll trun them into well-behaved ones in a relativel, short time. It gets time and hard work, but it is totally doable.
This book is very well-written and it's very simple and eas to follow.
If you have a dog, and you want to learn how to train it to behave in a great way, I highly recommend this book for you."

As a High School Science teacher, Captain Talos' motto is one I want to encourage my students to follow."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've read all of James' books on the Beatles, so was interested to see what he had to say about the Bee Gees. And, I wasn't disappointed. Because I didn't follow the Bee Gees as closely as I did the Beatles, I didn't really know that much about their history or much of their music. One thing I like about all of James' books, including this one, is the interesting tidbits of history that he includes - not only about the music and the bands, but about the time period in which they became popular."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Reads very good. The tips in this book are very good. This book is worth the little it costs.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Taylor Lee never disappoints her readers! Red Rock's Rebel hold this true once again!!! Loved this series as with Taylor's other series! Can't wait for the next book to be released!!! Awesome Awesome Awesome :)
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I enjoy this series for the facts that it is science fiction and erotic and a little kick ass. I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I loved the story of Sam and Chloe (or Same and Chloe if one of the typos wasn't a typo). It was a story of a long lasting love that just needed the right timing. Sam finally gets tired of waiting and hauls his lady back home to Texas where they build on  their relationship. The story was great and fairly well done. The supporting characters were a nice touch. Typos still abound with words that are poorly chosen (always spelled correctly but the wrong word in the sentence) and things that don't make sense. The winner for this novel - a car that becomes a truck then goes back to being a car, like the transformers children play with but in this case I think the author forgot what kind of vehicle she had Sam driving. As usual, I liked this enough to suggest others make the purchase. My less than perfect rating is still due to the fact that a proofreader is truly needed. Enjoy."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Here it all is in plain sight--the prescription for the endless wars and police states of the twentieth century.  It's hard to say whether the Torah, the Talmud, or the Communist Manifesto have been more influential on the lives of the proletarian drones urged to march to battle and destroy each other for a series of overlapping, frequently contradictory reasons.  If you google ""high arka conductors and artists"" you'll see part of a suitable satire on the subject."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What a book! I waited for what seems like forever for this book but really just a few months. This is the second book to Empathy so please read that first.

It's been 18 years since we left Ryan, Blake and Melody. After 18 years, Ryan is released after changing the lives of Melody and Blake. Is their love strong enough to endure the complete mindf&ck that is Ryan?

This story has so many twists and turns, you don't know what to believe or who to trust. It's truly an unforgettable read."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Julie Smith is a good writer, but could not get a really great taste of old New Orleans in this one.  Will go back to her full length books."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,This book had a real good plot but the book was such a bore to read. It only takes me one day or less too read a book but this one I kept putting it down. I will be buying another book before I decide if this Author is one that I will follow or not.
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.
I think this could be a really great book I just think it needs a little polishing"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This was a good read. I enjoyed it. There weren't many errors in this book. I can't wait to read more because it is getting more and more interesting.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was another mesmerising book about Shifter Grove and I thoroughly enjoyed the story;  it was a pleasure to read.  Danni feels betrayed by her boyfriend Taylor and moves to Shifter Grove, where it not only calls to her, but she is able to realise her dream.  Taylor doesnt give up though  he is relentless in his pursuit.  Danni, meanwhile, finds trust, friendship and love in Shifter Grove.  Rhett and Rush have returned home; they are billionaires but know that money cannot buy happiness.  They have made a promise to their father, and there is no way they can go back on this, irrespective of the consequences.  Danni has forgotten what it is like to date or how to get to know someone again after Taylor, but fate plays a hand although it is not all plane sailing.  This book was very well-written, and was a heart-warming and engaging story, which I would have no hesitation in recommending.  I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I liked the setup for this series and the characters in it. I would have liked to see more struggle between Kaden and Alyssa as they worked through her insecurities regarding their future. Also, more interaction between Alyssa and Kristi the jealous backstabbing bear shifter! I will be buying the next book in the series also. I can't wait to see what Mason gets himself into or should I say ""who"" he gets himself into!"

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,It starts with a young women coming out of a drugged like daze walking across a parking lot to a car she doesnt recognize but has the keys to it in her pocket. She wants to go home but has no idea where that might be.  As she starts driving she sees a highway sign that she thinks looks familiar so she turns on to it in the direction that she thinks might take her home.  After hours of driving she pulls up to a house she thinks is her home and knocks on the door.  The door is opened by her shocked husband and finds out shes been gone for seven months and has no memory of where shes been or why.  The next day she tells her husband that she wants to retrace her route to see where shes been and why. Now things really get strange but interesting. Its a really good plot and worth reading.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The story was well written but left you wanting to know so much more about the characters intimate moments with each other. What there was left you wanting so much more. YOU experienced their downfalls, frustrations and longings but it stopped there. Doesn't speak well of a supposed lesbian love story.

Not a memorable book for me.

Will leave this one out of my library and search for an author who gives me more intimate details."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This Book Is So So Good. This is a Must Must Read. It got every thing you want in a book. I give this book A Plus 5 rating
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I have not read any of the books in this series so I was excited to start this. I really enjoyed this love story. There was a lot of chemistry between Kate and Brody. Kate was smart, honest and down to earth, something I don't usually find in female characters. I loved Brody! He came across as quite vulnerable which I like in a male character. It made a change to see a male character like that. These two characters are great on their own but together they really smoulder. They show a united front and both speak their mind. The love scenes weren't particularly steamy, I prefer a bit more detail but I don't think that would have suited this book. The plot was good and very well written. Overall this was a wonderfully sweet, romantic book."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Over the Christmas holidays, I read several books celebrating the special holiday. This particular book was so touching and brought back some of my childhood Christmas memories. The short stories were all different and unique to the particular author. It was a beautiful look into their lives and most enjoyable."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"A nice read. short and compact.
The historical characters do what we expect of them.
For once, a Turtledove that was too short."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was my third novel by author Lorraine Carey. I was expecting that same Classic Style of adventure, but in Out of the Ashes I found Carey had exhibited her ability to add a twist on that old Classic style using rich Native American legends with the paranormal. Dean Banks is a teen who lives out west and is not your normal teen . He inherits the ability to have superhuman powers from an ancient Apache shaman as he alone must destroy it before it destroys a centuries old gold mine. I loved how his bravery and strong sense of spirituality were brought out in this novel. There is a touch of soft romance here that will warm your heart.. I think this is bound to be the best seller for young adults.
If your child loves to read the DEAN BANKS ADVENTURES are a must read. If your kid doesn't like to read Lorraine Carey has a gift for making stories come alive. This may just be the answer to get your child to fall in love with the written word.."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"A short, but sweet story and perfect for a light read. Amber does a great job of setting up a nice back story for her characters. From the start you know what type of characters you're dealing with as well as their struggles. I find in endearing when characters have to over come shyness,  doubts and misunderstandings before they can fully connect with the ones they love. Amber once again gives us a heartwarming HEA ending! Thank you for another truly delightful and enjoyable read Ms."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Love Julie Smith and the Baroness Pontalba. Just not a short story enthusiast.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I have the biggest smile on my face after reading this book; it's the stuff your dream romance is made of.  It's honest, mature, sexy, relevant, engaging and most importantly its romantic; swoon worthy.

I started this book ready to resist liking Arden.  While she is still not my favorite character in this series, the author did a phenomenal job making her softer and vulnerable while staying true to her ""real' personality.  I certainly understood her better by the end of the book and look forward to the author unveiling the rest of her complicated layers. I think the good doctor is just what she needed in more ways than one.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.  What I really enjoyed and respected the most was the way these couples dealt with conflict when it arose, textbook for classy and mature adults.  This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.  You simply cannot read this book and not wish you were part of this group's inner circle.

My favorite line in the book is delivered by my favorite man in this series, Cesar, he tells Athena ""You are the diamond Dee has been longing to treasure"".

This book is well written with its depth and characterization. The drama is not overdone (thank you) and the pace is perfect.  I feel as though I know this group of friends.  The men of this series are the type of men that every girl dreams of one day making their very own.  Well done.  I do have a question......Who is up next?"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This story is a prequel to the Men of Lancaster County series. I loved this story; it's well written, the characters are complex, and it will touch your heart. I have never read any of Mindy's work before but I look forward to reading more of her books. The faith she puts in this story is heart changing.
Joel Miller is out looking for his family's dog, Shadow. Joel's daughter Sadie had disappeared four months ago and his family is grieving the loss. Now her dog had taken off, probably trying to find her. Joel finally goes to the one place he never wanted to go to again, Daybreak Pond, Sadie's favorite place. His heart breaks as he sees the evidence of her love of this place but he sees sign that the dog could have been there so he set out to find a way to get the dog to come to him.
This is a story of a man and his family grieving the loss of a child. How to deal with their grief and how to deal with a God that they think took her from them. It's a heartwarming story of find God in the midst of a storm and giving Him your trust in the midst of your struggle. God has a plan and you will love it if you give Him the right to move in your mess."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Oh my gosh, I think this is the best one of all. Dave and Amy are on their way to Nate's place and run into multiple violent encounters with Zombies, bad guys, the government, Alphas, and very harsh parents. I loved the interaction between Dave and Amy, they are becoming a Dad and daughter and it is so great seeing him teach her how to survive this world. On top of this we are learning much more about the Alphas and the Asura virus. Definitely need to read these in order and just take a deep breath and enjoy.  So good."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Love everything Nicole writes and this is no different just wish it was longer...

Isaiah and Cassidy fell hard fast.  Great couple hope to see more of them in the future.

Great tease for this new series."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"It is an interesting story..but with a little work on the details, it will turn into a better story.  Yes I will follow the series."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Funny, but I don't recall the other book leaving out this much information, but then again it was this time last year that I was reading it so maybe my memory's not so fresh. This book is good, but one thing that threw me off was the passage of time; there was no indication of it. ""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way? And how did they decide to get legal guardianship? And why was the situation with Andrea helping out Adam and JJ handled like it was no big deal, just every day happenstance? And what happened with Grace Griffin? And this may be minor, but how on Earth did Thad get a new love interest before Adam's brother, Matt? Too many questions. However, these things are not guaranteed to keep me from reading more by this author, because his books have sweet story lines with very little angst."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"As always, I am SMITTEN with Tessa Dare's characters and the situations they find themselves in. If nothing else, the cakes incident would have sealed the deal for how awesome Rafe was. Yet, there was so much more to this big, lovable rake.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ordained Irreverence is part of a series of four Elmo Jenkins books.  I have devoured all of them.  They are the greatest.  While I am not part of the inner circle of the church politic, that is to say I don't get paid for what I do in the church, I know what transpires and Moody catches the spirit of the church with such good natured delight and pleasure that you can't help but love him and overlook the obvious shortcomings of those who work within the Body of Christ.  We are human and how God ever made us the holder of His way forward in the world has got to be one of the great mysteries of the age.  Moody captures that conundrum with good nature and good will.  I highly commend all four of these Elmo Jenkins books.  They are worth your eye sight."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book was given to me in exchange for an honest review.  It follows on and answers a lot of the questions posed in part one.  It has hot sex scenes and lots of dramatic sequences.  The character Justice, seemed a bit of a loose canon, for some one who needed protection, she seemed to wander freely, with no concern for those doing the right thing by her.
This is not normally my genre, but for light hearted reading, I enjoyed it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is my first experience with Author Sabrina and I'm so glad I read this. It's short, hot and very captivating.  I am a sucker for friends to lovers romance."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Its a good book. I enjoyed it, but there's a lot of missing words in the book. It must b something with ebooks. I read a lot, and I'he noticed ebooks have a lot of missing words. All in all tho, this series was a good a good read!"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Nick Cartwright meets his mate when his best friend finds his after moving to a small town. His best friend Seth found Kasey (see book 1 in the True Mates series) and Kacey's brother Thayne, turns out to be Nick's mate. Only Thayne does not want a mate.

Nick is hurt to be rejected by his mate, especially after such a wonderful encounter with him. He decides to leave and honor his wishes even though it nearly kills him to do so. All he has ever wanted was to find someone to love and be loved by.

Thayne had learned at a young age that having a mate can be a devastating experience if something happens to them. He and a friend make a pact that they will never have a mate - so this will never be pain they will suffer from. Now that he has found his mate, he is wondering if he should re-think this decision. If he changed his mind, could he handle the pain if loss came?

Nick is already feeling the loss of his mate, since he was rejected by his. Then a problem arises and Nick mating with Thayne is the only solution that can be seen. Can Nick do something so selfless knowing he is not loved or wanted?

This story was just amazing! I found the characters development to be honest and real. Nick is devastated, and Thayne is moved by what he has done. I was literally caught up int he story and could not put it down!"

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Good read, good storyline, good book to make people think. The characters learn to grow and make you think. Worth the read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I loved this book I started reading while I was at work and then continued when I got home and before I knew it it was 5am.  It is a love story that really fits in this day and age especially with the way things are going in today's times.  The Dr has an affair with the office manager and his wife moves to a small town and she finds the love of her life.  The small town contractor is down on love till he meets the new lady that has moved to town and he goes from playboy to loverboy without even realizing it.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is book is very interesting, it shows you how to start arbitrage retailing (a.k.a. selling online). Youre going to find tips, steps and some kind of precautions. You should keep in mind the authors advice in order to create and maintain a consistent online business. It also encourages you to use social media as a way to make yourself known and keep improving. It focuses more on Amazon, even though you can use it as a start up to any other online selling platform!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've waited three long years for this book and I was not disappointed. Claus and Alicia are two emotionally damage people. Their journey to happiness was a joy to behold. The way he helped her heal both emotionally and physically was priceless. I loved that Alicia found a backbone and peace within. I loved that Claus was gentle and kind. No matter how dark their lives got, they brought sunshine to each other. I'm happy that Dieter, Deja, Claus and Alicia found their happy ending"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This newest offering in the Men in Blue series is my favorite so far, Although Ben, Ryan and Shari have pasts filled with unimaginable horrors and have suffered significant losses, they continue to survive and thrive. That's not to say this book is filled with happy, shiny people. They story is populated with characters who support and stand with each other no matter what happens. It's great to see ""old"" friends from previous MIB books and the introduction of 2 new characters gives me hope that more stories are to follow. The suspense blends well with the lighter moments like the ""unicorn salute"" and the sex scenes are typical Jayne Rylon quality...smokin' hot. I received an ARC in return for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I was recommended to check out this book. I knew basically nothing about Norse mythology before reading this book. I enjoyed reading this book.  The author does a good job giving a general background and historical notes on the various gods. As a complete newbie to Norse mythology it was helpful and made for an enjoyable experience. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about Norse mythology.
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"The title states Cooking from the Pantry, but she gives a grocery list and some recipes to make from that list. Not what I was looking for or expected from the title. I'll look at it again and try a recipe, I'll try to anyway."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This one is another collection of my children's book. The story is adventurous and I love reading it. There are different characters that you would love to discover. Cant get enough of it...

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I just finished Barefoot Kisses, which was excellent, and then I saw this book! It's shorter, but sweet and hot, and fast paced. It was nice to return to the characters of Saltwater Kisses, too, which was the first Lakes book I ever read. As ever, clear writing, funny at times, and full of character."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I enjoyed this mermaid tale. I learned a lot about mermaids by reading this interesting book. The book was a nice mix of fiction and fantasy. It was an enjoyable read and the book shows that the author is very talented at writing in various genres.

Oceania had just turned eighteen. She traveled to the surface of the ocean to experience life on dry land. Oceania soon met a young man named Xavier. It was love at first sight for both of them. They soon discovered that they both loved music and they enjoyed making music together. Soon it was time for Oceania to return to her home underwater. She convinced Xavier to make the trip with her.

Oceania's father was not very friendly to Xavier. In order for this unexpected relationship to work, one of the characters is going to have to give up the lifestyle they have known for their entire life. Read the book to find out if the young couple's love can survive the challenges of their very different lifestyles."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This was another awesome installment in the series.  I loved the relationship/ connection between the black dragon and Kara.  I loved that this boll focused on having an emotional connection instead of a physical one.  Can't wait to read the next one!

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"As with all your devotion books, this one did not disappoint! Great read!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I came across this  book by accident and boy, am I glad I did.  It is a dark fantasy based on Nordic mythology, I think - but it did  not matter at all that I know next to nothing on the subject.  It felt like wandering in a situation, in the course of a walk in the wilderness - everything was normal but yet was not.  All apparently 'normal' protagonists had this underneath shadowy existence.  The pace was slow, like it happens in dreams but also just right.  Nothing was as it appeared at first.  A wonderful darkly joyous story.  Thank you Alex."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Interesting take but refreshing too.  I like all the different races mesh but then look at ""real"" life.  Somehow we all get along, sure we have our differences whether it's politically incorrect or infused"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Such a fantastic story! Accidental Alpha is the third book in Laurel's A is for Alpha Male series and I completely adored it! It was such a fun, quirky yet emotional read. Allison is back from her road trip with Hayley and learns some not so great new. I completely adored Wade too. He's so funny. I highly recommend and can't wait for the next in the series."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The book, Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is written very well but there are too many stories within the story which makes the book too long and keeps me from reading other shorter books.  It's more of a mystery book and I didn't expect it to be,even though
it's about Sherlock Holmes. As you can tell, I'm not too fond of mysteries."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Ninie Hammon is an amazing writer! I was on the edge of my seat through the whole book. Good vs Evil and so much more.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I really love this series and all the books by this author. The rhyming is great and the illustrations are adorable! Kids will love these books and I hope there will be many more. I can't wait to read them to my nieces and nephews. Well done.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I gave this 5 stars because I simply loved it! I feel sad that it's over and hope more is written. Maybe the little Lyon could grow up? I don't know. I simply fell in love with the characters and absolutely loved lyons very alpha and protective character.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I was glad to buy this whole set together so I could read them from start to finish. I have to admit .katie's story got to me--I was surprised to find myself crying at the agony she faced when her father was so cruel to hear. Glad Jake finally found a way to be together with Katie!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book along with the series is an excellent read.  I hesitated with the first book, because I thought time travel with civil war, but I am so glad that I went on and read the first book along with the series of books.  I would recomment to anyone that loves civil war romance."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"First read from Emma Hart and it will not be my last. This book was just the pick me up I need after reading a lot of MC books. Mia and her friends were downright hilarious and the running commentary that Mia kept having in her head had me laughing out loud. West and his filthy delicious mouth was the type of alpha male that every woman dreams of. He let's you know what he wants when he wants it and is very confident in his abilities (with good reason).  Mia didn't think for one second that a casual hook-up with West would result into anything but the pleasure that he gave her. West was thinking the same but come to find out neither one could get the other off of their mind. When Mia finds out that she is now working for him she decides that it will be just business, too bad her heart, mind and panties didn't get the memo. When two people who can't keep their hands or mouth off the other and have gave up on relationships do is anyone's guess but if you'll like to see what happens PICK UP THIS BOOK you won't regret it."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,A nice story about young love.  Using fruitcake as part of a love story would never occur to me but it worked here.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,A wonderful love story that endured the sinking of a Lusitania and a World War. I shed a few tears with this book and anything but a HEA would have been heart breaking for me. The author obviously spent great pains to get the details of the time period correct and it was greatly appreciated.  Im purchasing the next 2 books in the series right now. I cant get enough of Edmund and David.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Great new wolf series. Needed more. Hated for it to end. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. I love how when he spots his mate and she sees him, there is no stopping him from claiming her, but he's still a gentleman and won't force her. It was great how his sister helped him.  I received this book as a gift for an honest review. You need to get this one!!!! It's HOT, HOT, HOT!!! Patsy Sacco"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I love a good werecat/tiger shifter book, and Dawn Steele's latest serial is amazing. This volume of The Alpha Men's Secret Club continues Rust and Kate's story from the first book. The curvy woman is deep in the alpha's clutches, and things heat up as an old friend gets in between the two and makes things a proper love triangle.

Kate must wrangle with her feelings for the unreachable and powerful alpha shifter, or her classmate, who's genuinely sexy and possessive in his own ways. I loved the tension and explosive moments between all these characters. The story moves with a uniquely Dawn Steele energy and creativity that's hard to put down, even to take a well needed rest!

Can't wait to see how this ends. The twist at the end is pretty crazy and makes it a guarantee I'll get the next book!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

To see what N.K.'s idea behind Brandon's reflection was head over to the HEA blog!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This is a definite hit for Carolyn Brown.  Best book of the series of which all are amazing.  Recommend to everyone.  So loved Eeyore.
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,This story line had a lot of promise then crashed and burned out very quickly in the end .the one mindedness of the main character is a completely ridiculous and the lack of  insight is just plain stupidity . The way the author wrote his fights to where the main character gets into ridiculous situations get a lot worse as the story line goes on its gets sillier as the book goes into filling page's. A wasted opportunity  to really do something special  with the story line .
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ve5ry fast reading content., pulls the reader along very quickly;"

Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,What's with this unmentioned cliffhanger crap??? I was lured in to read this free book but I will NOT be purchasing the other TWO books to get to a predictable end. What wasn't predictable from the description was that the H was going to be a dumb F.. Amnesia from an accident? After coming out of a coma the H researched EVERYONE to help know who they were EXCEPT the one his amnesiac mind should have and that's the clearly lunatic scammer of a fianc&eacute;. How do you totally lust for the h but treat her like crap on a stick but your supposed fianc&eacute; who know one likes and her character is more than questionable you allow to squander your billions but give her all the respect she doesn't deserve?? And again you failed to mention this crap was a CLIFFHANGER.... Sorry hunny.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,A wonderful little short story. Definitely worth the time to read. Can't wait to read the next installment and see where these two go.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"It is a very nice story. It is funny and loving . Sometime I get mad at men who are so stubborn , but I guess we women are that way sometime to. It is romance and that is what the book is about and it is good."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I love a man who's a bit older.  In the Blacksmith's Bride, you meet yummy, brawny, often stern Abel and his sweet, innocent Sunny, or so it seems.

I think you will too.  Thoroughly recommend."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've not read a Bobbi Romans book that I didn't love. She hits the ground running on the first page, and it gts more exciting every paragraph. Her writing is steamy sexy, so not for my younger friends, but those of you who can stand some sex scenes, good stuff!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"When is the next book??  Wow!  This was sooo good!  It was very hard for me to put this book down once I started it.

The story was well written to the point I cried at times.  I could feel the pain and angst the main character, Ana, was going through.  Ana doesnt reveal what happened in her past right away but there were enough hints that I was heartbroken for her.

I was rooting for Ana through the whole book and it was a complete rollercoaster for her (as well as for me!!).

I don't want to give anything away as to what happened with Ana but there is a huge cliffhanger at the end of the book. It was one of those that sucked the air out of my lungs because I couldn't believe what just happened.  It was one of those endings that I had to sit back and give myself some time to digest and figure out what I will read next.  Book 2 isn't currently out or it would be a no brainer what my next book was."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is the first time I have read anything from this author, but it will not be my last ! Her romance stories are so good ! I can not wait to read more of her books!!!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,I'm no prude but these stories or what pass for stories were just plain crude and disgusting. Not worth reading even if they are free.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,These stories are very well written. I can't wait to read the NEXT one. I just don't know who is next to fall in love!!!
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Nothing like a NY hood story. Always drama!  Fake friends always come into play. Where is part 2 I'm ready to find out more.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This was a wonderful story it had me laughing out loud a couple of times the food that was cooked and the way everything was worded made cooking such a sensual treat.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This was a great sequel to the first book.  Also they seemed to have corrected the proofreading problems that were inherent in the first book, Polar Bear Dawn.  If you haven't already give them a try."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Things are starting to heat up now and secrets are coming out. Will he reveal all of them and is he really falling for her or is it just a ruse. I'm intrigued to find out.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Another thoroughly captivating, kept-me-up-reading-all-night story by Josh Lanyon. The story being told in Griff's POV really worked for me, I really connected with him, and reveled in experiencing everything through his eyes, and having access to his impressions of everyone he met. Griff and Pierce made for deliciously intriguing main characters, both having their demons and past hurts to deal with, a past Pierce was so reluctant for Griff to open again..but which he eventually benefited from. The author once again gifts readers with a substantive and poignant portrayal of the human heart.

I loved the distinctiveness of all the secondary characters, each of whom had a crystal clear portrayal.  The Long Island setting and mystique was a character in its own right - I love when an author portrays setting so vividly that I feel as if I am a participant within the story and not simply reading it. The mystery held so many possibilities, just when I thought I was sure of one facet, I found myself doubting... excellent maneuvering of plot, with a great twist at the end. I'll be reading this one again - even though I now know the outcome of the mystery... the lovely nuanced writing style of Mr. Lanyon freely lends itself to new discoveries upon re-reading."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved every part of this story. It was entertaining, creative, had a dry sense of humor that I very much appreciate, and had the perfect ending. I found myself chuckling more than once. Great great story. Mr. Fry is quickly moving to the top of my favorite indie author list."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This was an excellent first novel and I enjoyed reading it.  I hope he writes another also set in Naples.  The West is the Best, Florida-wise!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This very enjoyable story takes unusual directions from the start. Our heroine is a young woman of respectable background who has had her life ruined by a wealthy man. She has been banished to a convent. Meanwhile our hero is a man who went to America as a trader but took the losing side in the Civil War and has returned, with only a ship, to take up a family title. He learns that he will relinquish the lands if he does not marry and produce an heir by a certain date, which is only a few months away. This option appears to be impossible until as luck would have it, he meets our heroine who is in an interesting condition.

A somewhat creepy item is that the hero's ship carries the remains of his mother whom he wishes to bury on her family land. Why he could not do that without owning the land is unclear. The wish seemed tossed in to make the hero more altruistic and less land-grabbing. We are reminded of a certain character several times by the heroine pointedly asking what can have become of her or a message she carried. This builds to a suspense finale which again is most unusual in period romances.

Read, enjoy, be surprised. There is lots of fun historical detail such as how inheritance worked and this has to be explained to the hero for our benefit, he having been in America for twenty years."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Short, Sexy and Steamy&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K.  MY THREE FAVORITE COLORS!

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This one is a 4 star read also! This one picks up right where the other left off. This is another short read but you won't be able to put it down. Of course you get more insight on Nick and Becca. And she's still a firecracker and I'm loving it!  I wish the 3rd was already out so I can see how this series goes, can't wait for it! And the ending to this one OMG, what is gonna happen.  I really wish these books were longer cause you really get caught up in the storyline of it. Would definitely recommend this series!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now. ""I want to kiss him more than I want to follow the rules or remember why I cannot trust, or hope, or notice the sun."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Still crying!!  I have loved these books from the beginning.  What a love story and such heartache.  This is a must read for the Legal Heirs fans.  One door opens and another door closes.  Finn and Bly come to an understanding in a time of desperation that bonds them forever.  The kids.oh boy...you can't help but love them all.  The rollercoaster is never ending and this time is very sad.  Have your tissues ready.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"If you are looking for a quick romantic fix this novella length book might be your answer.  Josh and Mindy are easy to like and they will have you rooting for them after just a few pages.  Mindy is going through a rough patch and what better than a handsome man from her past showing up stranded and looking so fine, to take her mind off her problems?

You could literally feel the tension in this book.  It grew to exploding.

I think my favorite scene may have been the cookie frosting scene.  :)

I loved the happily ever after ending.  It ended just how it was supposed to to make my world happy.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you.  There is also some swearing."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This book is so, so good.  I wish I had known about this series before, but I will definitely being going back to catch up on all the books I have missed.

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

I received an eARC of this book compliments of the publisher in exchange for my honest review and opinon.  All ratings and opinions stated are my own."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Have enjoyed this series from the first book I read. Makes me laugh out loud, especially when the animals are 'talking' to her. Can't wait for the next series in this book. I know. I try really hard to read really SLOW, but I just can't. I'm done the book in no time and have to wait and wait and wait."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"King Hall is the first book in this paranormal romance series. If you like Elementals, vampires, mages and shifters this is the book for you. The four mystical prodigies Ezra, Pearl, Jack and Lily are the future kings and queens and they have some wicked powers. There is action, love, loss and an amazing friendship in this story. I loved the way they bonded always being there for each other no matter what. The story was easy to read. There were some great twists in the story keeping you on edge always wanting to find out what happens next. And Scarlett ends this first book with a great cliffhanger and I hope she doesn't keep us waiting to long for book two. I am definitely looking forward to continuing the story and finding out what happens next."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"James Smith has a keen sense of not only how to suggest a plethora of tasty soups, but he also takes the time to explain and give photographs of the various soups he mentions along with precise preparation and ingredient lists and tips for preparation.

His manner of presentation is as easy to follow as his recipes are mouthwatering to read  - and make. For the health conscious this is a gift to the kitchen library. Grady Harp November 14"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I enjoyed the two stories contained in this book. These are the only books by these authors that I have read.
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,Too many too tedious stories. I got bored after a while with endless convolutions.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,This was a cute book but felt very rushed.  Nico and Kat meet and instantly fall in love.  His family seems very accepting for someone who just appearred in their life.  I was glad that she didn't forget her goals and education simply because she fell in love.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I received an ARC of this book and it is the first I read from this author. It was alright. I thought it had its moments but just not something I would read again or really suggest unless someone wanted a quick read.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Among Wolves is the first book in the series Children of the Mountain. Story is penned by R.A.Hakok, this book is a suspenseful thriller that would send a chill along your spine while reading. The story is spun around Gabriel, a sixteen year old boy who overcomes his fears and saved his loved ones. The book contains suspense, thrill, excitement and even humor making this a blend of a good work piece.

As Gabriel finds the truth about the missing Secret Service person as his body is found frozen in the mountain with the bullet story in the head, the plot makes an opening. This suspenseful book will make you want to read from beginning to end to find out the mystery and the dark secrets hidden.

Get ready for lot of twists and turns which are embedded in this novel, a real enjoyment for those who like post-apocalyptic stories. Theres a bit of romance in the story, lot of action and an entertaining mystery appropriate for all age groups to read through.

The story flows to shows the reality that might happen if a nuclear winter ever comes to pass. You can see the world through the adolescent age Gabriel who has a wider view on the concepts of the outside world. The book brings out a remarkable piece of fiction that can be enjoyed reading. Among Wolves bring out a well set plot with gradual character development making you get familiarized with the roles and to understand the situation. This book is a great read for thriller lovers! I rate it 5 out of 5 for the entertaining value it has and I'll be waiting for the next installment to read. Thanks."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The premise  of the course was quite romantic and as a result the reader conjures imagines of the novel should be.  This book at times felt like a noble from the nineteen century.  Also it promised hot steamy sex, don't waste your money it contained none."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Loved all the Brand stories both Texas and Oklahoma, waiting for more."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Even though this book seems to talk about how to communicate a girl, I found that this book can be used for anyone for things other than ""seducing a girl"". Knowing how to communicate and how to use eye contact right is a skill that anyone should have. And I found a lot of great tips and fun exercises included in this book to help you train your eye contact and make it better and more powerful. The exercises in this book are definitely worth looking into. For example, Robert teaches you how to take a shower by alternating the temperatures of the water to train your eye contact, which is a bit challenging and fun to experiment. I've learned so much about ""high-status eye contact"" and am convinced by the book that it is so important for everyone to have this type of eye contact whenever we want to deliver powerful and persuasive messages."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Short and sweet. I enjoyed the story i just wished it had been longer. I would've like to have seen how she turned him down before.
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a huge fan of MC books but am not really that familiar with the world of BDSM so I was determined to read this book with an open mind. From the prolog B. b had me hooked to read the story of Colt and Tuesday. I loved that girls attitude from the get go, I loved the way they met and how their world's literally colieded. Their backstories are masterfully intertwined with their present and just made you want to be part of their journey even more and get to know them and the family that Colt introduces Tuesday to. Colts explanation of family to Tuesday is perfect:

""You were raised believin' family is in your name - that it has something to do with blood. ""
""It has nothing to do with that s*** - that's all accidental b. s - the s*** your born into that you can't f***in' control. ""
""Family, are the people who are there for you, who've got your back, and you know dam good and well, you've got theirs too! You don't just run away from them!""

Tuesday has some knowledge of Colts world but from a twisted dangerous point of view, he introduces her to a safe version of the world of BDSM, that has her wanting more. Along the way you learn how his bond with his brother Kash was formed, you learn how important trust can be and the lengths the brothers will go to, to protect their family. I've loved Colts journey so far and can't wait for his brother Kash' to begin."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This was my first Heidi Hutchinson book. I really enjoyed it and plan to read more of her work. The only issue that I really had was the characters age verses their maturity. I would've thought that they were in their late teens, early twenties at the oldest...but otherwise a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,What an awesome read! Melanie Shawn masterly crafted this suspense-filled romance that I could not put down! This is the first book in this series I've read and I'm going back and reading the other four ASAP!
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,The female lead (I cannot call her a heroine) is an idiot. In the beginning of the story she reminisces on how she should have listened to her friends about how bad her ex was and how she wishes she had paid more attention to their opinions at the time and maybe she wouldn't be in the mess she is in....and then she goes and does it again. I just can't support a character that I constantly want to shake some sense into.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What an amazing collection of stories. If you like spanking, erotica, and cowboys this is the box set for you. There was not a story that I did not like in this set. Each one is as strong and alpha as the next."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,If you enjoy tongue in cheek narrative for those of a certain age this is for you. More of a grin than a laugh out loud read. Two retired detectives that have been friends since childhood. Actors in disguise becoming victims and suspects. Secret door ways and tunnels. Various potential motives and a long list of less than healthy food choices. Fun read even if it was a murder mystery.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is book 2.5 in the series, but the first one I've read. (It was free on Amazon.) I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very well written and included all of the things I like in a book - courage(female especially), protectiveness, great banter, and of course sexual tension just to name a few.  One thing I really appreciate is that even though it is a part of a series, it very easily stands on its own.  I don't feel the need to read additional books in the series, but I probably will."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is an ambitious, grand sexual adventure set in Arthurian times. Ambitious because Arden takes on myth and has managed humbly to make them human. She doesn't sell out her characters in favor of spending valuable time describing or focusing on the universe, nor does she in ore it completely. I was astounded by Arden's fluency in historical detail, not to mention the authenticity of the gay male sex acts. She proves that any sex scene can be arousing to anyone regardless of orientation: the passion, hunger, and starved desire of any person makes something sexy and arousing."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is book 5 in the Montana Born Brides series. The books in the series all take place in Marietta and the pending celebrity wedding of a local girl gone big time links them together. The neat fact is that the books in this series are written by different authors. I enjoyed Magdalena and Jake's story. We saw them both in previous books and we knew that Magdalena had returned home with her teenage daughter after being gone since she became pregnant as a teenager. She has been the topic of small town gossip because she has never revealed the name of her daughter's father. Jake is a famous country singer who is taking a break because he's lost his muse and is unable to write any new music. Although famous, Jake is down to earth and likable. Im not always a fan of love at first sight, but Jakes feelings for Magdalena are sincere and based upon not only her looks but her singing. This was a good book and a nice addition to the series.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I love sports romance, but hockey romance is by far my favorite! I now have read all seven of these fabulous Carolina Cold Fury Hockey romances and I have loved them all for different reasons. They all have different types of twists to each of them. Now I have a new favorite, Roman! I loved it and flew through the pages!

I am not going to rehash the story for you as the synopsis gives you a good set up of what the book is about. There is drama. there are steamy love scenes between Lexi and Roman, but it is a slow build with lots of flirting and innuendos and they are so sweet together. It is wonderful to see how their growing infatuation turns into a deep caring relationship.

The new twist to this book is there is a concurrent love story developing between Brian Brannon (Lexis father that she recently found out about from her dying mother) and Lexis free spirited boss Georgia! Lets just say Georgia really knew how to loosen up that stuck-up suit! Another twist is the family dynamics between Brian, Lexi and her half-sister, Gray. Gray had a hard time adjusting to the idea of sharing her father (Brian). Gray, as general manager of the Cold Fury, had issues with Roman and his personal and professional trouble making ways. Roman didn't like her management style, so they agreed to disagree and their disdain for one another put Lexi in a bad position; choose between her new family or the man she was falling in love with.

If you love sports romance that has a bit of drama, fun banter, steamy scenes, touching moments, and crazy secondary characters, then give this book a try. You won't regret it!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. Another great boxed set by Nikki Steele, who is a wondeful author. Loved this story of Libby and Jax. So sexy and romantic. Libby has a complex about her looks and an eating disorder she has trouble controlling. It is all mainly due to her beautiful sister who recieves all her parents attention and the fact that she stole Libby's first boyfriend she loved..She can't believe when she meets Jax, that he could care about her the way she looks. She is scared that if her sister meets Jax, she will steal him away from her like before. Loved this series, especially how Nikki ended each book with a wonderful recipe that Libby had cooked in each story."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this story from start to finish. Alana Ankh has created a whole new world that is filled with magic and is very compelling. When Ivy and Kris meet they are not supposed to have a connection to each other because they come from different races and have a different set of cultural norms however despite these superficial differences they can't stop thinking about each other. When Kris devises a way to get Ivy with him again it works and Ivy becomes Kris's concubine; flouting the wishes of his parents and breaking a betrothal. Ivy and Kris have a kind of whirlwind romance that has political repercussions for Kris. This story has love at first sight, fights both physical and verbal, societal pressure, and two men that fight through all of that nonsense to make a real life together."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I'm going to be completely honest and say I'm still trying to figure out if this book was just ok or just something that could have been ok but left me feeling like it was missing quite a bit it had too many cliches.

Jagger comes from not so great of a childhood and Tatiana comes from a childhood of abuse, so they have something in common which is the crappy childhoods. And of course, it's what brings them together which is maybe what I found so cliche.

He's an ""underground"" fighter and has been in trouble with the law yet he is the one who gets in trouble because he tries to help her.

I don't want to do spoilers so the best I can say is - it's sad when you know exactly what direction a story is heading and you keep reading hoping every cliche won't be used.

I loved that all of them had doubts, they sounded real. They felt lust, love, jelousy and all the things you feel when you are in love.
Another thing I adored: they are not ""perfect"".... they are very ""human""!
I also have a lot of fun with the side characters, and Iam crossing fingers to get their stories!
Iam so happy with this one...because I found Lane Hart this year, and she rocked my world with the ""Cocky Cage Fighter series"" And now this series is having the same effect! YAY!

'Nefarious', 'Ruthless' and 'T Wave' were all full of deceit, suspense, thrilling scenarios, romance and an abundance of characters who fit the role of 'bad guys'. Alton and Mallory make such a great team. They truly compliment each other and their strengths make them the ideal couple. David and Fahima are such an awesome couple. Their romance was so endearing. This series had me hooked from the first chapter in the first book and didn't let go. I look forward to reading more."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Lost Wolf was a wonderful mix of lost and found. It had me in tears, and wishing Kane could remember who and what he had lost, and glad
about what he had found in a world turned upside down. I recommend you read the whole series. It's a great story."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.  Seriously... made me laugh almost every time.  And not because he was being intentionally funny."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series and I hope she continues with Jack and Zoe.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A really fun book to read.  I found humor, relatable characters, romance, suspense and a few twists to make this book a must read.  I am really looking forward to the next book."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"No doubt about it - the MacLaren men are still as special as they were back in 1866.  I would really like to know if Heath is the grgrandson of Niall.  He reminds me of him.  Look forward to the next installment, ""Hard Landing"".  Also, ""Deadlier than the Rest"" book 5 in the MacLarens of Fire Mountain Series.
Love all of Shirleen Davies' books!!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"When I read third and final book in this series, I almost cried!
Then I read the book. I'm still disappointed it's over.  But I love this series!!

Blake made it home to S-Island in book 2 #Fight. Alexis and Zach were together and things
were odd.
But Alexis proposed a solution; they just be together. Black, Zach, and Alexis.
Could the men do it? Could Alexis?

Before anything can happen, crazy Claire decided she was tired of Alexis getting in her way and tries to take her out. In the process both women find their way to a biker camp.
Women are traded for goods. Alexis is kept with the KingPin who is useless.
She comes up with a plan to rescue herself and any other women willing to escape with her.
Blake and Zach are planning too. They need to get their girl back.
Can they do it before she is killed or hurt?

This is another fast paced book, that keeps you on your toes and thinking.
What's going to happen? Can this work?"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Really enjoyed this bundle.  What a value and such great entertainment. All the books in this bundle were really good reads and exciting.  Love the characters and the storylines were compelling...everything I look for in my favorite books!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Don't know what I was expecting, but this small book touched me.  Thank you, Joshua Graham, for this. I needed it."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...
Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.
While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.
By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Sometimes you read a book that you just devour. You inhale it. It consumes you. This is what The Perfect Life did to me.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Off Duty is a fantastic addition to Sawyer Bennett's Off series.  Tim and Holly have amazing chemistry, and Tim's son is the cutest.  The story is also set in the beautiful city of New Orleans.  A great second chance love story!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This wAs a great book and I can't wait to read the other books. It was very erotic and I was aroused the entire time I was reading it.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed this story. Hud and Mack are great! It is the third book in the series but can be read by itself (or first) without any problem whatsoever. It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It was a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I was missing something somewhere. I really enjoyed the characters and this story.
I received a copy in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Very good as a debut novel! So many questions I need answered but I don't want to spoil the book! This book had me really into it! If I was the type to cry over a book I would've went through a whole box tissue! Great job Jade!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,What Nix & Kadence go through with PPD is so real! Perfect writing again River Savage. Can't wait for more.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Great read first-time I have read any of H.Y. Hanna books but it was wonderful.  Read it in a day just couldn't put it down
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Such a great read, all about Alexander Hamilton. Since I am not fond of our history class this book gave a lot of information to me about Alexander Hamilton. His life and events in his life that were really inspiring and extraordinary."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I am probably not the best person to write a review for this book. I love this series when it first came out, and now with each book I just get more and more disappointed. This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance. The sex was typical for these types of manlove books. I was just annoy cause it didn't connect or update on any of the other books in the series. Really this is not a series!!!! These should all just be stand alone books."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"this is a great recipe book full of delicious desserts, they would be great to make for parties or for when you are going to have dinner guests"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I don't typically eat Vegetarian because I need a lot of protein. But this book intrigued me -- protein and vegetarian?  The author talks about some things that are very familiar to me -- like protein keeping you from getting hungry -- as well as other tips. Her comments about how it's easier to add meat to a vegetarian dish than make a meat-based dish vegetarian resonated. Then there were the recipes. Yum!  Even if you're not a vegetarian, there are a lot of good recipes in this book."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This is a really good series by Deborah. I love her books.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Granted, the storyline is improbable ... come on, a magic jukebox?! ... but the book is well written.  Because the author spares the reader of unnecessary, over-the-top scene staging - the story moves along nicely.  The characters are well developed; the author did a good job in mapping the relationship between Diana, Peter (her fianc), and Nick (the jukebox pick).  Plus, the life situations are believable - from Diana attaining self-confidence in her own decisions to Nick resolving the anger over his Mom's betrayal.  I'll stop there, so as not to give away the story.  I finished this book in one day, which is a testament in itself!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"As for the Story-line, I can't say anything I didn't say the first time this was published. Now, what I can say is that Thankfully this Wonderful story was taken and revised to answer any and all questions a reader might think was left open. What really made me love this Author more is that the Editing that was done, was done with the utmost care, so that the flow and ebb of the story was so smooth that you read 'The End' too soon.
This Revised version gave me as a reader what I felt it was missing the first time. An Endless, at the edge of your seat read. Really can't wait for the next books in this series to be revised.........Fall in love with The Trinity and All the Alphas in this wonderful series."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. What got my attention are the details on how a person can really push through the limits and just go out there, be confident on yourself and start making conversations."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Totally enjoyable, well written with some unexpected twist in plot which added to the novel's character. The bonus was even hotter.  Good writing, few errors, easy read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Alpha werewolf Yeager stumbles upon his mate during a biker get together in a small town.  Theres just one problem: his mates just a child.  So he resigns himself to waiting for her to grow up.  Years later, he returns to claim her, only to find that his arch-enemy has also discovered his mate and wants to destroy any chance Yeager has for everlasting love.

The idea of a werewolf finding his mate when shes too young is a new one for me, and I enjoyed the twist.  It also added a dimension to Yeagernot just that hes a good man, willing to wait, but also that when he shows up years later, hes been yearning and lonely for her all that time.

The addition of the rival wolf and the extremes he goes to to keep Yeager and Cassie apart gave the book a lot of tension.  AndI won't reveal any spoilersbut the ending is a whole nother twist that I didn't expect.

I liked the characters, the unique ideas and twists in this story and thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I bought it because it was free and will buy more by this author.  It was a novella but the story was complete with a few surprises.  I highly recommend Allegra's Song and can't wait to read the stories about the two sisters.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Wow! This is very well written and HAWT! It's very short. Less than a 30 minute read. It's more like a scene from a book. I'm hoping they know each other at least in passing. What he does is like rape. But she's the one that opened the door after he told her what would happen. I want more though!
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Planning on reading the next one because I'm still trying to find out what's going to happen with her and the Mountie and if she ends up staying in the tundra

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,These megapacks ALWAYS deliver.  I have never been disappointed with any one of them I have purchased.  ESPECIALLY for the price!!!!
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"""trail"" used instead of ""trial"" several times. Afford should have been affordable in that context. It could have been longer."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Not sure where it was going but it kept me riveted.  I pretty much can count on Elin to give me a great story every time and this was no exception.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ben and Jake are so adorable and sexy. I loved every minute of this book. I experienced every emotion while reading this story. It's so hot! I was so sorry when it ended. I need more. Towards the end of the book there is a surprise development, I hope the author will take us on that journey with a second book."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"So you know how the hero is always doing something stupid and you're heart is breaking for the heroine and you hope he get's his crap together for her?  Well flip that LOL.  I wanted to slap Penny upside the head on more than one occasion.  It's a good thing that girl learned cuz I was ready to just take George off her hands.

This was a good story and a great part of the Going Royal series!"
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,I loved the story line..... Great H and ok h (lost respect for her during the story due to some questionable and not very h like behavior).  I also found the story to be kind of long winded....and I found myself skimming through what to me was filler and fluff to lengthen the book.  I enjoyed the read but with could have done it in two books.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"It is interesting but I elected not to read the entire book. With all that is going on in government today, this book just hits too close to truth.
 I did read about 5 of the first chapters and the last chapter and decided I was glad I did not read the entire book because even though it is part of a series, it cannot be read as a stand alone. You are left hanging and so really need the next book to find out what happens."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society. When you get into these books you will start noticing the author has a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the lines of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series.

Highly recommend the book to anyone who loves sci-fi / military books or just anyone looking for a great read in general."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Stefan and Claire are truly engaging characters and their emotions are honest and raw. The turmoil and conflict which confronts and divides them results from human trauma which could threaten the strongest relationship.
`Forget me Not', by Nina Blake, is beautifully written, the intrigue is gently presented and is skilfully unravelled against the striking backdrop of Australia's Sydney Harbour.
An absolute page-turner.
Highly recommended."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the series of the mating season, in one he meets her to young in her life and when he let's her go to live it will he be to late to claim her?

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Kia can start fires without matches. It just happens and there's nothing she can do to stop it, fire is a part of her. She's got fiery red hair and when she gets emotional there are flames she can't control. She was kicked out of school because of a fire she started and is now living with her grandmother, who works on a large estate. Being there brings Kia more questions than answers. She finds out the hard way that the surrounding forest isn't safe. There are creatures she's never seen and they aren't very friendly.

Ethan is used to everything that lurks in the shadows. He knows a lot of terrible secrets and is carrying a heavy burden. He likes Kia from the start, but he knows she isn't safe at the estate. He keeps his distance, but Kia is too smart for him to continue hiding things. He's afraid of what will happen if she finds out the truth, there are sanctions Ethan wouldn't wish on anyone, especially Kia. Will he be able to protect her and does she actually need to be protected?

Red is a great story about an interesting house with a fascinating forest. I loved reading about each creepy creature and like Alyxandra Harvey's vivid imagination. Her main characters are easy to love, which automatically meant I loved the story. Kia is fierce and fabulous and Ethan is responsible and brave. They are opposites who complement each other. Therefore they are a good match and I enjoyed reading about their numerous adventures.

I loved the fact that Kia has fire. It was fun to read about her abilities. She's passionate and the fire shines through in everything she does and it's the base of her personality, which is something that made me smile. Alyxandra Harvey's vivid descriptions of the forest and everything that's lurking there are fabulous. I loved her colorful and creepy monsters and the fact that the story is mostly about what it's like to be both the hunter and the prey. I really enjoyed reading this fast-paced adrenaline-packed story."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I really liked the story. I was not fond of the ending. I would recommend it.  It's short sweet and enough to keep me interested.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Definitely some hot steamy scenes in this one -- but the constant Bea negativity was wearing on me.  Maybe if I was in her stilettos I may have felt the same way.  Nevertheless, good story -- hot characters."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is yet another great addition to the Back-Up series and I loved reading this! The full range of emotions are covered here and I loved how well everything rounded out with this novella. Reading this entire series has been a great adventure filled with complex characters, an incredible storyline and an author that always leaves me wanting more. I highly recommend reading this to anyone and I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I really enjoy novels involving angels and demons so this was a given for me, especially considering it was published by Random House Flirt, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite publishing imprints. This novels plot kept me thoroughly engaged with its battle between good and evil. Sophia St. James moves to a small town in Connecticut, never expecting to see Guardian Angels in spirit form. In fact, she is the only one who can.
Sophia was a great character. She was strong and brave and I loved her narration. Michael was the angel. He was moody, protective, and volatile. It was really hard to figure out what he was feeling, but I loved his character nonetheless. He had good intentions. Dante was the Demon Knight who was convinced that the reincarnated soul of his lost lover was in Sophia. He was one of those evil characters you couldn't help but somewhat enjoy because of their passion for whatever they are doing. Regardless, I am definitely Team Michael. This novel had the typical love triangle (good boy, bad boy, and the girl stuck between) but it had a unique spin on it that prevented it from becoming a trope.
Forbidden was a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining novel about an angel, and demon, and the girl who cant figure out who she wants. I cant wait to get my hands on the second book, Awaken, because I am sure that Lori Adams will continue to write a great story."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.

When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.

EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""

""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.

Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.

Beth Bradley.

Liar. Sinner. John. ""

There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.

This book is written in the 3rd person with both heroine and hero perspectives, it's unequal--there's more heroine than hero. I'd rate the steam at PG-13. There's a few scenes, but they aren't very explicit."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,It was a great book. I had lots of fun reading this one. The love that you see is so wonderful!!!

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review. I really enjoyed reading about Spencer, the bad boy that is taking the blame for his brother to avoid royal scandal. There is alot of drama and steamy scenes. I recommend this book!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I wish this prequel would've been out before ""Seduce Me,"" part 1.  This prequel gives some of the background on the main characters, Ashley and Brandon, in ""Seduce Me.""  And, includes the reasoning behind the actions taken in the next installment."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I haven't read any of the other SOLD books, but this one was good, so eventually I'll try to pick up the Dragon and Bear ones!  :)

The book is set during a time when there are very few fertile women, so they test all woman and auction off the fertile ones.  Alphas Chase and Grayson bid for Rowan at the auction in hopes of her getting pregnant by one of them.  They aren't the monsters she assumes when she goes up for auction.

Yes there is a lie involved, but all for a good reason.  Loved the book but it seemed really rushed at the end."

This was a very good book, if you like fantasy this is for you; the characters were well written and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Gideon Affair

Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.

Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.

And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.

Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.  You will feel a variety of emotions reading this story but I promise you, you will enjoy every minute of it!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Of a series! This series not only pulls you in and you become part of it, but I'm finding many similarities within these pages to my own life and have gained insight regarding those similarities. I can't believe I've read 8 of the 9 books plus the shorts and vignettes within a week's time. I'm a fast reader but this even surprises me. I highly recommend this series to everyone as it's filled with fun, some drama, some mystery and intrigue, but down right good small town living as it should be."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,What could he possibly be thinking? What the hell is she thinking? As you can tell I just want to punch both of them! Going to the next book!

She has heard all about Cole and what kind of photography he does and she wants no part of it. But some things occur and she ends up putting herself in a bad situation. Maybe there are things she doesn't know about Cole Stevens and things she can learn.

I want to know so much more about the prophet Richie, Free's cult, and how it will all play out. Why is Richie in jail as he tells this story? I read this book from beginning to end, full of intensity. It's not over...not by a long shot. Hurry Mr. Sharp, I need the next book!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Love love love this story. I've waited 3 books to find out what happens with Ross and Kyle. And RJ has delivered. With a big win. Awesome story and great set up for the next one. Woohoo. Can't wait for Christmas.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,This was a good story. Fun to read. Nothing too exciting if that is what you were looking for.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Loved this book from beginning to end, it deals with real life issues  people deal with every day and at the same time had you laughing, Ronnie has really changed for the best and love his family and only want the best for them"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was an amazing read! L. Ann Marie always has the perfect combination of action and romance to keep the readers wanting more.

Mitch knows she needs help. Her ex is watching her at the door of her college class. She knows what this means but how is she to get away and get her daughter and get somewhere safe? At the end of class when a large hunk walks in she knows this is her chance. So she simply asks him to walk her to her car. She never expected for him to give her his truck and tell her where to meet him later. She also has no clue where this all will lead."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This is a reasonably entertaining book, though one needs to gloss over the often transparent plot and pretty one-dimensional characters.  The story line (prison world, alien technology with untapped potential, corrupt political system, rogue army general, a hero not fully aware of what he is, etc.) is not particularly original, but it hangs together and has no glaring holes even if how some of those holes are filled is at times not particularly credible or even meaningful."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,LOVE! The whole series kept me not wanting to put my kindle down!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I like how this book picks up right where the first book left off. I enjoyed it more than the first book and was very surprised on how Jenny Lynne made it work. I really didn't know how it was going to work out. As usual, the characters are their awesome selves. The book was filled with betrayal, action, and drama worth reading. I was satisfied with the ending of the pretend story told in the hospital room and the actual story. It made me hopeful for a better future to make the sacrifice worth it. The book held my attention the whole way through. I'm not really sure what else to say. I really thought it was well put together."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,This book was delightful!  I love time travel books and that it's centered in New York City made me enjoy it even more.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this series! There was a couple errors, but nothing so bad that is slowed me down. Can't wait to read more from this author."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I once had a friend say ""I hate to have to think before I speak.""  And being a ""do unto others"" kind of guy, I couldn't help but think how many times I'd had to think before speaking with this person.  This great book made me remember ""Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting.""  Spread joy in the world.  Read this book and it will be easier to do so."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"i love all mailorder bride books keep them coming, thankssherry"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I fell in love with with Crixus while reading the Matilda Schmidt series. This just deepened my affection for the irreverent demigod and introduced a new favorite feisty femme fatale who can more than hold her own against his charms.

Can't wait for the next installment!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This is a great book to share with your kids where you can both learn some really cool things about caterpillars!  Some really interesting facts that will get your child excited about learning and these cool creatures!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I am pleased to say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story. It is definitely a new take on the usual shifter stories and I loved the detail of the surroundings and the vulnerability of the characters. I am looking forward to catching up with the next book in the series. I was given a copy as an arc in exchange for an honest review which was handy because it was on my wish list!
I am happy to recommend this for an afternoon escape."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,i liked this story it was a believable story i only had a few complaints i think she still acted like an adult alot of the time i would of liked it better if she had to give up all control and really lived the lifestyle while in his home.  and i didn't like that she had an affair. sorry for the spoilers.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Original and great series. I don't usu read fantasy type but this series is so good that no matter the genre you get sucked in. Writing style better than most with the occasional odd tense or participle. I would guess English is not original USA variety. So technically she could be correct while sounding off ... Example: he swimmed across the river and leant into the wind (shorter paraphrase) I would write as he swam across the river and leaned into the wind. For some reason that kept bugging me. Fabulous characters that grow and change, surprises everywhere, great fun. Be aware they start free and cost more at the end. Which is fair and smart."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I like friends to lovers stories but this one was just OK.  I think for me the two had been out of contact for too long so the idea that either was harboring interest was a little far fetched.  Having said that, the characters had good chemistry and even though there was the usual angsty reason why one of them pulled away, at least the author didn't let that drag on for too long.  Not a  bad read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I read the series of 7 books all in a row. That is MOST unusual for me. With few exceptions, I read the first book in a series and don't bother with the second book. The characters in the Emperor's Edge are strong and well drawn. The action is basically back-to-back, just the way I like it. The only criticism I can offer is one of personal taste: there was more introspection by the characters than I like, but it did not stop me from enjoying all 7 books. Well done, Ms."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A good story about choices. Tessa chose to break her engagement and leave without giving the Real she did so. She returned after three years to ber family and the man who gone on with his who still loved her, but was afraid to start over."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I absolutely love this series. The Ravens are the hottest protection force there is. They will do anything to protect and provide for their Fated. Can't wait to start the next book.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Just finished this story.  A little long on the details but I wouldn't have missed it for anything.  Always a great story line by Andrew Peterson and The Nathan McBride Series - well - keep them coming!!!!
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"It took a while before I got into the story, then I ended up liking it. Good fast read for anyone"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Want to read more by this author it was such a good read!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I received this book for an honest review. This is Nicholas's story & the 6th in the immortals series. You can read this alone but its much more enjoyable if you read the others first. I enjoyed seeing a different side of Nicholas. Kitara is a nice addition to the series. Once again the Saints are causing problems for the clan. I cant wait to read more.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,The audible that I bought along with it only went half way through the book. This is a long and repetitive book with English from the 1800s that makes it slow and difficult to read. An updated version may be preferable.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is an interestingly written book covering multiple time periods. The book of Hours was my favorite. I found myself looking forward to reading more entries of the diary. This book touches many emotions starting from the opening of the story. It catches you by surprise. There was no warning of what was coming. The opening was executed with precision leaving me a bit stunned. And then there is the promise dictated by the Book of Hours- find true love; something most of us want, so it keeps you reading and digging your heels in. This book has some of everything-love, desire, betrayal and even show biz. Dangerous Liaisons indeed.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Nice read, good characters, sweet love story.  Enjoyed reading the conclusion to the trilogy.  The touch of suspense added to its appeal."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"this was a great read, full of mystery, betrayal, greed and scandal and an undercover female writer, everything that makes a regency romance book worth reading. I loved the ending, when the H decides to write the ending of h's book that was based on him by saving and marrying her, bringing her book to life."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,I like the story line and the characters had potential but I felt the story was rushed and jumped to much I couldn't enjoy it as much as I usually enjoy shifter stories. Has potential when the next one comes out.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this book! I wrote tons of notes for myself which I don't generally do but it is packed full of great information and ideas. Some of my favourites were: Be childlike! As a child you believe you can do anything. To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. (the author goes into this and it is really interesting!) Create a one sentence business destiny. (again-awesome) Success is not magic-its hard work! and Stop being busy. Start acting out of priority. I mean I could go on. There are examples of perseverance and hard work and free bonus materials that you can download. If you want to change the direction your life is going or if you want to be successful in what you already do then this book is a must read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Wow!  Sometimes a great book comes along that grabs you and you can't stop thinking about it.  The his is one of those books.  Give yourseld time so you don't have to put it down.
Violet is recuperating from a serious accident that killed her fianc and left her badly scarred.  Her favorite pastime is ogling her sexy and very hot neighbor, as he repairs his roof.  When he falls from the roof, Violet rushes over, only to find him sprawled on a trampoline.  Making sure he's fine, he admits that he knew that she had been watching him, and wanted to meet her, figuring this was the only way it was going to happen.  For the first time Violet wants to let loose, to be reckless, something she's never had the courage to do, as the future CEO of Walker Construction.  She wants Noah, that is no secret, but she can't let him see her scars, so they embark in a just sex relationship.  How can she do this without baring herself.
When Noah sees his sexy neighbor watching him, he pretends to fall off the roof, hoping that she'll come over, so he can finally meet her.  Noah knows that Violet is hiding something since she only wants them to use their first names, and why is she always wearing scarfs when it's not even cold out.  As they get to know each other, they both start having feelings for each other.  However, how can they go forth when she doesn't trust him enough to reveal herself and her secrets.
This wonderful story is about hope, love and realizing that when you find true love, nothing can stand in the way.  I received this as an ARC from the author for an honest review and this is as honest as it gets."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"All I can say is wow!  This one was such an exciting read with many unexpected twists & turns.  When Sydlynn reached her breaking point & released everyone she's ever cared about I was in shock but could definitely understand why she did it!  I cannot wait for The Gateway to come out in September, it's going to be so exciting to see what becomes of Syd now!  Well done Patti Larsen!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved the characters, she was feisty and oh so smart mouthed ... Could have done without the bad language. Never understand why we need to use the ""f"" word however the book was fast paced and action packed."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Loved it..l found out so much about my Kindle Fire.  I found out things i could do that i didn't know about.  I had this on my Kindle Fire when I purchased it but didn't think much about it because i have owned so many Kindles before.  Well one night i had no internet access and all i had was this manual on my Kindle to read...because i had no other new books at the time.. i was amazed at what i could actually do with my Kindle Fire.  I am so glad i read this Manual.  My Kindle experience has been broadened.  I will never look at my other Kindles the same as I see my Kindle Fire.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The first thought that comes to mind when thinking of this book is funny. It had me laughing out loud. There were other areas that kept you enthralled and those that reintroduced Tiffany's parents. I really like her sidekick, Ian as well."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"PG13 - No sex, but there's a great deal of referring to our H's extreme Man Whore promiscuity, but no detail.  (And, yet again with the ""tongue ramming"" comments from the earlier books), some violence.  Finally, no cliffhanger, and a GREAT ending.  Ally and Griffin are perfect and Ally is a heroine worth emulating in so many ways.  I love it when the geeky girl gets her HEA!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A good collection of crime and some surprising solutions.  Couldn't help but wonder how the lady detectives were
viewed at the time as none of the three fit the Victorian ideal of the shy, self effacing, dependent wife and mother one was supposed to aspire to.  No fainting away like the heroines of Mrs. Southworth's books who wrote at the same time."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,GO TO  PLAY STORE TYPE IN  PSTEC  8 MIN TO GET RID OF A BAD MEMORIE  YOU WONT BELIEVE IT
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,It's always pleasant to find a book that is enjoyable from beginning to end - especially when you discover a new author at the same time!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Book 2 of the series starts 3 months after the first book ended. Jenna and her five year old daughter are trying to live a normal life away from Lilly's father who happens to be a crime boss of the London mob. Jenna and Lilly barely escaped death at her father's Cornwall property. So Jenna wants to stay away from Farrell Black. However the people who want to kill her are because her father found out a shady lab was developing a bioweapon. Jenna discovers she and Lilly are far from safe and turns to Farrell to help. But Jenna and Farrell realize they must stop this evil group that is willing to kill and threaten. This story becomes extremely exciting as Jenna and Farrell travel from Italy to England to Amsterdam to Germany trying to stay ahead of the murderous group. The book is sit on the edge of your seat exciting but also advances the loving and sensual relationship of ore hero and heroine. The ending makes you want book three immediately but June is the last installment. I highly recommend this series.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"If you want this series for the sex, it is great. Unfortunately, at the end, it starts to kind of get a story line and that replaces the sex. If you're looking for a story, get the bundle. If you're looking for sex, get the individual books."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've read this entire collection,  then wanted every second book there is. Something for everyone! Great bunch of authors and great books."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Well, I just finished number eight. So glad to know there will be more. Every brother has had a different story with the most unusual women. I loved each book and couldn't wait to finish. Now I will look forward to reading them again in a few months."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Interesting take on the vampire genre. I enjoyed it. Great pace and great characters.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I enjoyed these stories very much. 4 stars because I wanted more! Each story could have easily continued to be something even greater.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Good characters, well-written with good story plot and one very busy professional lady involved in many things. Her life was hectic with a strange type of love life that most women would not appreciate. Women want answers and stability. Good book to read and you will enjoy the heroine who does not seem to have much joy in her life."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I rated this book a 5 Star because it kelp my interest from  the beginning. To the end . I could hardly stop reading it. I would recommend this book to ladies who like love stories.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The stories are good but the pictures leave something to be desired, in fact at times when we use this book there aren't pictures tat show up and at other times they do.
Kindle touch seems to be picky about pictures sometimes. Would consider buying a physical copy of this story book."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This book was fantastic! So many twists and turns it keeps you reading well past bed time. This book has everything and I can't wait to read part two which I just bought!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Alpha Cleo has finally found her match or rather matches!  Two very strong, gifted and sexy alphas in their own right, they show Cleo it is a good thing to give up control occasionally.  The boys, again, are not your everyday alpha males.  They have their own insecurities when it comes to Cleo.  A very honest and refreshing change from the macho alphas portrayed in other shifter stories.  Love this author and her approach to the 'other side' of reality.  A quick hot read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Always exceed the expectations. So many twist and turns you must pay attention and too often what appears to be that is not the case. Go reread THE BLACKS!!! D CAMILLE did it again!!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I loved the Oklahoma brands just as much as the Texas brands.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is not a powder puff story, no no~ this is a meaningful heartfelt epilogue of all epilogues.  If you haven't read the first one of the series, do so immediately.  Then brace yourself for this one.  I am not sure how this author captured the emotions that both devestated and enlightened at the same time, but she did.  She rocked the story and wrapped it up in a bow that doesn't trivialize the struggle but emphasizes the success.  It's sexy and hot, heartfelt and painful.  Shit, I may just cry..."
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,This was a rip off of Ivy Symone's CRUSH series. Same storyline but with a horrible delivery. I knew I read this book before. Sorry if u are gonna read this storyline get the ORIGINAL one from Ivy Symone cause this is a terrible one!!!!!!!!!!!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

This was an excellent read and I hope there are more to come ... and soon!  Thank you to the Hill's for this wonderful series,"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Thicker Than Water ~  Wow!  Not just a saying but life experience and TRUTH!  I always wondered about the 'why' of two people raised in the same family, and yet turning out very differently and I am intrigued by the experiences people have and how they perceive them.  How far would you go for a loved one when that person is in unbearable pain? Is letting go of them considered mercy, or indifference?
Great questions indeed!  This book takes a look into what drives us as human beings and why we do the things we do.  Terrific, meaningful, quick read!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Intrigue, suspense, romance, secrets, and inseparable best friends all add up to an enticing mystery.  And of life changes happen along the way."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Any author who wants to include magic in their stories has go think of a consistent magic system unless s/he wants to be inundated with sneering letters from readers who love to pick things apart. K M
Shea combines recognizable  elements to good effect: the ability to read things into life (Inkheart), a magic council (too many to name), and magic law enforcement(ibid). The story move along a good pace and the characters are enjoyable."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I thought the first one was awesome, but this one was even better their story was even more fun, probably because of the other stories involved.
Really enjoying these stories."

Forbidden Series, Book 1

Regina Puckett

Reviewed by Roy Murry, Author

This Young Adult read is for the young at heart like them and me. It is fun, bizarre, and delightful. Some of the reasons I keep coming back to Regina's short novels

In this adventure, Liberty, a young lady pilot of an airship, goes about her business of bartering items needed in her post end of times world.

On one of her stops to deliver goods, she takes on the task of caring for a robot who has feelings. On a stop to get water fuel for her ship, she encounters other humans.

The adventure begins, and Liberty breaks all of her dead father's rules by engaging the robot and the humans. She finds love, a trait she has been avoiding all her life.

How this all comes about and how Liberty changes are the lessons learned in this novel; some that YA's should learn.

An enjoyable quick read. The way I like it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This was definitely a short story; leaving the reader wanting a few more pages to just end the curiosity of what happens next. Would recomend this to anyone looking to read a story of calling the wrong guy and then frantically searching for him.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Party of Three: Sunday Night Dinner Club book 1 by Jess Dee is the beginning of a new series and what a terrific start. I loved the main characters of Spencer, Chelsea and Levi, but I actually found myself a bit torn at first on whether I wanted all three of them together. I adored Spencer right from the start, maybe it had something to do with him being an Accountant, lol :) Of course, that soon passed as I love when best friends share the same woman. The sex scenes were scorching hot and I enjoyed the fact that Spencer and Levi were able to discuss their feelings for Chelsea with each other. I also liked that this story introduced secondary characters who are long-time friends and I loved the close friendship that was portrayed and the fun bantering. I am really looking forward to all the stories in this series."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Warning- some spoilers inside:
Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better.
Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry.
And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing.
The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.
I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book was just wow... So good! So much makes more since to me from the Sizzling Miami series now.
So Chase's old Dom dies and leaves him alone with the Dom's sons who are cruel to Chase. He asks Ty for help and Ty then agrees to take him on after talking with him for awhile.
Then you jump ahead a little bit and see a lot of characters from the Sizzling Miami series which I loved! They slowly build up their relationship together which I thought was perfect and I could really feel the love between these two.
The Dom and Sub relationship this author portrayed was awesome! The whole storyline with the action, angst and the steam just damn so many scenes in this book were so hot!! I thought the way everything round out was perfect. The author grabbed me from the start of this book and I ended up staying up almost all night to finish this book! Then there was the ending which I will admit I teared up while reading it because I thought it was the perfect ending for this couple.
So altogether I really loved this book!
I would definitely recommend this book!
I received this book free in exchange for an honest review from Inked Rainbow Reads."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I love how RE takes you on a journey every single book she writes. I am going to hate to see this series end. There is so much  stress today, it is nice to have a place you can go to for a little while with a HEA."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"After finishing The Cypress Project, I was eager for more, so I grabbed the other two novellas for the series. I wish I had I known, before buying the Kindle version, that this one was available for free online, because it was not nearly as long or satisfying as the previous novella. The cover is absolutely stunning, yes, and the content is interesting. Its just that it was over before I knew it, which was really disappointing. The glimpse of a new secret on Arras was definitely cool (and came in handy when reading the next book), but it was just way too short. Why did I rate it the same as The Cypress Project then? Well, I liked the content  I just wanted MORE! Seriously, save your money and just read this one online."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"As a homeschool Mom I am always looking for new and wonderful ways to teach all of my subjects.
Since I can't just get on a plane and fly all over the world with my children it's nice to have such vivid beautiful pictures to show them of these countries landmarks and tourist attractions.
There isn't a ton of content but what is there is vivid and beautiful and the descriptions are short but apt.
This picture book is set in Italy and deals with the most famous attractions there such as
- Vatican City
- Pompeii
- Venice Canals
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa
- Amalfi Coast
- Lake Como
- Colosseum

I find that this is a good addition to my geography and social studies lessons. For any age. It isn't extremely detailed and it isn't long on pages, but it has great pictures. A great introduction to the important places in Italy.

I recieved this for free or a discount for my honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"When I first began reading ""Contessa,"" I wasn't sure if I could keep reading it. Livvy seemed like a spoiled brat and as the mother of a teenager, the last thing I wanted was for my escape (reading) to be like my reality.

But as I kept reading, my worries were put to rest and I loved this story as much as I loved Lori's ""Lost and Found"" series.

An amazing book and, as always, Lori tells an amazing story!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I have learned a lot about faith, the power of prayer and forgivenesss throught out this book and the whole series."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"If I had read this book first, I don't know if I would continue with this series. However, since I am reading it out of order, I recommend this as a good read. The others get better."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,I had hoped this book would have been better than the first. It was a LITTLE BIT better but not much!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Definitely suspenseful. Great comic relief. A great story.  It is wonderful to read a true love story, and one not based on carnal lust. A beautiful story."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is an Fantastic book. You really need to read, part 1 and 2. Then read the next generation. All five books, are really, good. You will cry and laugh in this book, also."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The story was short but it was nice to read about Tristan, Keisha, Nate & Jada again. I hope that the next book is longer and picks up where this left off...too much left hanging. I'm loving Mrs. Clara & Rev. Johnson. I can't wait for their next appearance. P.S. The girl on the preview future cover needs a lil more sun."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"With a name like that, what's not to love? Nothing! When Rowena impulsively runs away from her father's impending second marriage, and lands in the arms of Jonathan d'Abelard - the Iron Hawk, a legendary knight, adventure abounds! The Iron Hawk has plenty on his plate already without an impetous girl! But they stay together and fall in love along the way.

Jousting! Intrigue and smoking love scenes! What's not to like?

The only thing that kept this from being a 5 is it needs a bit of proofreading, but it is good anyway!

I was given an ARC for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Book 2 in this fantastic series..it's just great. Love this one as much as the first one. Can't wait to continue on!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Reader. . and that is all that needed to be said for me to dive in even running on almost no sleep. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. Besides the fact that the series is written so good, you can't help but be pulled in by the characters and push yourself to keeping going and see what happens next. This book is equal amounts of thrill, angst, and hot steamy sex scenes."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Love this sweet story set in the Midnight Deltas world. Billy is Sophia's (main female character from book 1) 14 yr old brother. He wants to ask one of his fellow students to the Valentine's dance but he's too nervous. In steps the men of Midnight Delta...burly, take-no-prisoner Seals, who all offer Billy advice on what to do. The most important being to respect and take care of the female.
I loved each of the men and thought they were sweet and funny and so caring. I recommend this sweet novella."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I enjoyed this journey very much. It had just enough drama to keep you interested. Just enough evil to make you angry. Just enough suspense to keep you guessing. And enough love to last a lifetime. I left individual reviews for each book in this trilogy. I wanted to separate the reviews so it wasn't based of the combination. I'd highly recommend this bundle (individually or as a package). I have enjoyed the other works from Georgia Cates. She is a fantastic writer. Looking forward to what is in the future.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Amazing read. The humor,the wit and the amazing insights to everyday issues. Sign me up for any book MR Robertson writes."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This love at first sight tale is made unique by the willingness of every single character's willingness to make the marriage work.  From the very beginning the mail order bride, her husband, his very surprised rich father and all of his daughters give their all to make this union a successful one.  Good read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received a free copy in exchange for my honest review.

Theo and Mac were best friends turned lovers. Only one doesn't remember the only time they hooked up. I was hooked from the start and fell in love with this story. Mac is the one that got away. He lost her once, he won't lose her again! You won't regret one clicking this!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.

Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.

I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.

This one had action, forbidden romance and a lot of fun moments. One of Georgettes best books in my opinion and I definitely recommend to fans of paranormal romance."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I really liked this mail order bride book. It was a nice clean romance book. I would recommend this book to all my family and friends

Jennifer is this girl who had a bad realtionship with this one guy, did not so swell in college, and finally stopping at technology. She likes and opened up a repair shop with the money left over from her dad. So far she's glad she hasn't touched Grammy's money. She receives this e-mail one day and it's from her granddad, which is strange because he isn't alive. She can't really do much about it now. Her parents are dead and Grammy is to. So what can she do but head into Grammy's room to figure out some answers. She enters the room to find a suitcase full of pictures of everyone. She soon falls asleep and wakes up to Marshal the landlord waking her up with coffee waiting. They chat for a while and comment on how the place looks like nerdville with all the tech stuff around the house and Jen's video game collection. So Jen goes to get ready and they head to meet this granddad. The story goes on and even though its a short read it is so page turning that i got this book done in no time flat."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Damn you Jenn Foor!! You made me cry throughout this ENTIRE book!! Moreover, you made me like that spiteful and conniving bitch Heather! You made me love her and feel sorry for her and want everything for her...how could you do that??  I wasn't prepared for all you put us through in this book! I gave this book 4.25 stars, if you haven't read this series, you really should, those Mitchell boys are freaking HOT!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was the first book I ever read by Kerrigan, and like every book since, it left nothing (and everything) to be desired. Fabulously written, amazingly deep characters (especially for a short story) beautiful love story, and a whole lot more. Nothing left to be desired in the writing, except that it leaves you wanting more. Always more! I devour Kerrigan's books and just cannot wait until the next one."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Yes, this is a new writing style for the talented MS EDWARDS.  She has shown more talent than when she wrote as MS NICOLE EDWARDS. And, I didn't know that there ever was that much talent had existed.  Being able to write books that are that good and being that different is phenomenal. We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I URGE YOU TO READ THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE SERIES.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SERIES.
SO, GET THE BOOK AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

HAPPY READING MY BOOK FRIENDS......."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Once upon a time I dreamed of being able to pick my future husband out of something like the Sears catalog. I mean they'd invent it before I was adult, right? Seemed so obvious to me. I couldn't understand why they hadn't done it already.

So it was to that kind of place to which this book took me back, certainly as the character Cherie describes her desire to order up the perfect man, and then goes on a funny and insightful journey of eroticism, rejection, conflict, confusion and pulling it all together again. This book was a very enjoyable elixir."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What an absolutely delightful story!  The plot revolves around a lonely schoolteacher, a troublemaker student who just lost his mother, and a widower father trying to be both parents.  Melanie, Simon, and Hank are endearing characters.  Their perseverance in deciphering the puzzle box was inspirational.  This is a short story so obviously the romance will be at a rapid pace.  But it is believable.  I really felt the holiday spirit after reading this story.  I will definitely continue with this series!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Seems like a good variation on the sex in space stories that are out there right now. Featuring 3 humans  including a smart heroine made this a good read
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Great informative book on investing advice. The book is well-written and very helpful in terms of proving investing advice to beginners.

Great Read."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I gave the book two stars because at least the author tried to teach the reader about wool and spinning, but that's about the only entertainment value I could find. I couldn't get into the book. I just couldn't find the rhythm or flow anywhere. The writing style is very juvenile and just odd. I couldn't finish the book but at 35% I couldn't invest anymore time. Here's some text from the last page I read so you might understand what I mean. ""Slowly, the lid to the trunk creaked open and just like he knew, Henry emerged from the chest."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Disappointed!!! Everything happened just as expected - no twists or turns or unexpected plots.
Not an Amish story at all!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This second in the Last Librarian trilogy is about a complicated future world where it is hard to tell the heroes from the villains.  The world is peaceful, but at what price.  I am starting on the third book immediately."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"It was good. There was one part I did not like, the 3rd person in the room during intimate times. There was only one or two instances of this behavior, but I thought it would have been better if it was kept just between the couple. I appreciated that only he was allowed to discipline."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"M. Robinson did it again!
This book is amazing! Brilliant.

This is a spin off of the VIP trilogy. We've met Brooke and Devon in VIP but now it's thier turn to tell the story.
They are both so broken that to others they only show their facade. At the beginning of the story Brooke is 16 and just like every 16yo girl she is full of hope and dreams. But in her case, those dreams and hope dissapear and she closes herself and becomes very good VIP. It's all about sex and pleasure.
Devon's life wasn't an easy one. He knows how hard you have to work to get something in life.
They are both broken and they need each other if they admit it or not. At first there is very beautiful friendship, but they both know there is more. So much more.
Their story is full of pain and loss, but also full of love, hope and scorching hot scenes. Whoa, M. Robinson knows how to write hot scenes. Reading this book I cried, I laughed, I swooned and I was fanning myself. This book is amazing.

Can't wait for more from M. Robinson."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Seriously....this just gets better and better. The intensity of emotion and their relationship , connection and magnetic attraction continues to build. The suspense and mystery deepen and we get a glimpse of Drakka' s formative years. The chuckles and LOL moments keep shining through. And Finally some private time for our hero and heroine with the intimacy they each have been craving..is stupendous....until it is not...and  we are left with a sense of extreme loss,emptiness,confusion,loneliness craving and sense of numbness .A lot of adjectives in attempts to describe what an emotive sensual and visceral experience Devon Hartford provides?Get used to it...because I have already begun part three and it is definitely an upward sojourn!"

Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,"Boy did I go wrong with this book. I didn't know this had so much sexual content and far too little Sci-Fi. There was no need to have physical and sexual abuse and I stopped reading because that was where it was going. I'm not pleased because had I been warned in the blurb I wouldn't have gotten this to start with.

My copy came from Net Galley, Im sure they didn't know that it was not rated properly there. I left this review to warn others so that they didn't make the same mistake I did, thinking this was Sci-Fi. This review is entirely all my own."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Liz and Landon have been together the better part of 4 years. She refers to them as peas and carrots. They go well together, but there is not a lot of excitement. They are busy, sometimes ships in the night.

Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and it it makes Liz want to find a way to keep it! She wants to be strawberries and whip cream instead of peas and carrots. And they have it, at least for now.

The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

I have to say I cannot wait for the next installment in the All About Love series. The author has really brought her A game to these books, so be prepared to enjoy with plenty of chocolate and tissues.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Oh my gosh I was so happy to receive this ARC, in exchange for an honest review.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This was a great book. Strong H and spunky h, just the way I like them. However, I would have liked more intrigue, with what the H had done for the crown. Spy stuff, espionage, etc. Anyway, overall, it was a Cinderella story and much enjoyed."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"RC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review. Taming Alaska was amazing!! It was a thrilling page-turner with well-developed, witty characters. Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Ella's gifts weren't what I expected. This is, in my opinion, mostly a love story with a side plot - murder.

Ella's had a horrific childhood, loosing her mother right before her eyes, but the ramifications of her death go deeper than she ever dreamed. Ella's grown up pretty much okay, except for a recurring nightmare, but like has gotten better. She's met a guy.

I like the love story in the book. The murder story wasn't as plausible to me, but overall the book was good and I'd recommend it."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something."

Eric and Nick are a couple who can't find the strength to enjoy each others company because...What would society think.  Both have parents who believe in their children.  Eric tho has a tough time no matter what he does and Nick longs for the love no matter what it takes from Eric.
They both need each other.  The writer makes the story hard to put down for its realism.  Can't wait for the rest of books."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Very nicely detailed book about the maldives . The author has done very nice research and got a lot of good information collected about the places to go and the things to do. It seems to be a must go place in our lifetime not just for honeymoon but even for a nice little vacation. Great book..
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Savannah Martin has not had an easy time of it. At fourteen, her mother abandoned her and, despite being fostered as part of a caring family, the scars still run deep. Returning home after breaking away from an abusive relationship, the heartache is not over. The patriarch of the family has been murdered and the family is reeling from the loss and the continuing threat to their business and their lives. Jared Corbit is her sister Lexis boyfriend and she wished she felt brotherly thoughts towards to him. What was she going to do?

Told from Savannahs point of view, her emotional turmoil feels so real. There seems to be one punch after another to herself and those around her and the anguish and she feels cannot be hidden. The author knows just the right thing to say to convey the mood, the feelings of uncertainty, pain and love. And there is a lot of love in this story despite tackling the serious issues. Abuse and its ripple effect, abandonment and its life-long consequences are at the center of Savannahs struggle as she tries to deal with her family and the situation she finds herself in now. Jared is more than she feels she deserves and the roller coaster of events that happen don't ease that feeling. Surprising twists and still a lot of uncertainty has me eagerly looking for the second part of this two-book storyline."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This is part of the Families War? series. War in the far future with a slightly strange group of heroines. A fast pasted and interesting story. A neat series of technologies that make everything sound possible.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,IT WAS FUN TO READ THE CURRENT INFORMATION ON HOW THE ROYAL FAMILY SPENDS CHRISTMAS.  I READ IT TWICE.  IT DOES NOT HAVE MANY PAGES BUT THOSE PAGES ARE LOADED WITH INFORMATION. VERY ENJOYABLE.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I love historical romance with strong heroes and heroines. I also love to watch what happens to them when love enters the picture. S. G. Rogers did an awesome job with Larken and Brandon. The conflict was there right away but the attraction was paced. The plot twists near the end were genius! At the end, the author mentioned a sequel. I can't wait to read it."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I liked Braydon much better than his brother.  It was a good read.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I was surprised Viviane found herself and was able to bounce back from her cheating husband. It didn't take long before her cheating husband found her desirable once more. It took seeing her with another man and her transformation to realize he had a good woman.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Pennsylvania 3 begins to reveal a lot of crucial elements about life in a new world.  Much has changed.  More than our Jed can grasp.... but he is starting to.  Everyone is after him and he doesn't understand why a simple Amish boy can be so valuable.  There is some good action in this one and almost as many new questions as answers.  That can only mean one thing... must...read...on.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Great to see Morgan back in action, so to speak! And even though there weren't as many sexual escapades in this story as in the others, it was nice to see Morgan connect with someone on a deeper level and figure out more about herself. And the little twist at the end with a villain from the series will definitely make things interesting for Morgan and her men! Can't wait for the next installment! Crossing my fingers that the next one is longer and we see more of Morgan's favorite men!!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was an enjoyable, fun read!  It took a bit for me to get into the book, but then I didn't want to put it down."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I love the book oh my gosh it is amazing a true test of love heartache all so bittersweet. The most amazing read in an truly excited to read the sequel. Jasmine the no nonsense woman and chase the enigmatic playboy both excellent characters
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"As we all know and love this author, it was not a hardship to read this book.  I thought it was well written with a interesting storyline, and who can resist Darcy and Elizabeth.  Of late the novels available have all been short and as such I am always disappointed with their length.  Well written with a different and interesting storyline, but come on all you P&P authors, can someone please put out a full length book."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I liked the plot of the book, but I'm very confused by the ending. It seems as if it's not a standalone book, but that the second is from her friends point of view, but about Stephanie and Denny's relationship. To each their own style, but I find series better if they are all in one point of view, or if they have a happy ending and then move on to other characters stories. I just feel like it's left hanging.

I feel like the dialogue was forced. Some of the things the characters said had me confused. I feel like in some places info was just to be assumed by the reader and not explained. I felt like it jumped around in some places and then in other things were dragged out. Things happened without explaining and I had to reread chapters thinking I missed something.

All in all, it wasn't bad. I love books with babies, I just feel as if I'm left hanging and have no way to fix it."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I won't repeat a book blurb you probably just finished reading. If you've read the first 4 books, then don't stop now! I just finished this one and am only pausing long enough to tell you to get this book. If you haven't read this series, start with book 1 because you don't want to miss any of this! Love the characters! The book is about demons and demon-hunters, but it's also about the love and strength/power of families. I read....a lot!! I don't normally gush over the books I've read, but I'm making an exception here! This author knows how to bring a story to life!"
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Compared to the first one, this was okay. There is a lot more sex and it is much more graphic."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I'm so happy all worked out in the end. How many times we've heard of selling our souls for material gain, well after reading this book we should all be content with our lot in life."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is a good shifter romance, with a likeable couple that you want to get their HEA. It is a quick read, just over 70 pages, but the characters are well developed for such a short story. If you are looking for a quick, sweet, and sexy shifter romance, this is a good one."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"What kinda ending was that? Wasn't really feeling this book, it took me forever to finish, when I usually read 2 a day."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,S K heats this story up with each segment that comes. This one is no different from the other. The characters and storyline remain as exciting and strong as from the beginning. Loving it more and more as it goes on. 4.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I really enjoyed this romance book.  Selena and Peter are really likable characters and I enjoyed their interaction together.  Selena was a free spirit who could not stay at one job for long and Peter longed for her.  I enjoyed their story and it was a fun read.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,I started to really get into this book but it was to short and by far had the worst ending possible
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This is a game for those who want brain exercise.  It's fun and challenging.  It's a different kind of word game!
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I recently came across this author. I read ""A Girl Like Lilac."" After I finished it, I checked this authors amazon for more novels. I decided to go ahead and download this one. This is powerful reading. Definitely worth the time. These two characters will show you the meaning to Best Friends. They stick together through everything. I am not putting no spoilers in it. This was one of a journey. The ending leaves you wanting more. To me it felt like a cliff hanger. Incomplete. I will read the next one when it is released. Great powerful, emotional kindle read."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I love time travel and this was time travel at it's best.
Claire is strong, smart and still mourning the death of her husband.
Hugh is an 18th century Highland warrior who by some twist of fate is hurled into the future.
This was a welcome change in time travel since the heroine is the one that usually gets to time travel. Not so in this book. The hero is and well culture shock is lame considering everything the hero is put thru.
From start to finish the story just drew me in and even though it was late I did not go to sleep until I was finished (sleep is overrated *wink*)."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I read about a chapter of this book. The writing is irritating, being 99% heroine's inner dialogue, with tiny phrases of conversation every page or so. The action freezes solid while we examine the heroine's inner thoughts, her past, her toenail polish ...

Forcing myself onward, I discovered this chick is truly too stupid to be out on her own. She let her former boyfriend walk all over her, steal her blind and humiliate her on national tv. This doesn't fit what I've heard of successful ballerinas, who have to be intelligent and tough as steel to make it to the top of their profession. It also does not give me a heroine I can relate to. Now she's chasing after a cage fighter ... and is so TSTL she leaves her expensive coat with cell phone and wallet in a cheap dive bar while she pirouettes off to chase the hero.

I suggest the hero run the other way as fast as his muscular legs can carry him."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,A well depicted story of the historical times. Strong characters with captivating descriptions of a desperate time in history.  A good story.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I would like to begin by making it very clear that women are not the only ones who are subject to betrayal from their significant other. Although it may be harder for a male to admit, we also can be hurt and severely wounded emotionally by our spouse. With that being said, I was a little cautious about purchasing this book only because it is written by a female and I feared it would only be targeted to the female perspective.

Boy, was I wrong! This book was written for females and males equally. As a man reading this book I never felt like the author wasn't talking specifically to ME. Since the author went through these experiences herself, you can tell that she wrote from the heart and can empathize with everyone of her readers. It's almost as if I am listening to a close friend or family member offering me heartfelt as well as straight to the point, detailed instructions on how to overcome, move on with your relationship, and heal. I will definitely be recommending this book to any family and friends who share a similar experience."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was a very nice book to read. I read it to a small group of adult for a literacy project an everyone loves it.

So inconclusion i liked this book."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Quick read full of easily obtainable goals. By following the seven steps listed in this book you are certainly setting yourself up for success and happiness.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.

A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season."
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,"I don't even know what I just read I couldn't even finish it, it was just so bad I honestly do not know how this horribly written book got so many 5 star reviews, When I could barely get past 15% of it. The writing was horrible and I couldn't find my grove at all finally I Justus started skimming through it BUT I still couldn't get into it and I love mc books, but sadly this was just not ready for the big times."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This author keeps me coming back; I want to make time in my day to read.  She hooked me with the first book and I just can't wait for her next release.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read that kept me interested. I couldn't help feeling for what Paige went through as a kid and how it shaped her life and her families. It truly shows how when one person in a family is ill, it affects everyone.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Of course at times I wasn't always a fan of Jake's attitude, but as the book progressed he got better. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this enjoyable series.

ARC received for a honest review"
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me. Might as well tell me his tragic backstory of bowel movements."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I used to think that I'm reading fast and efficiently but after reading this book, I realized I have so much more to learn and I still have bad habits to remove. Reading this book helped me learn about various effective techniques in speed reading such as developing better comprehension, concentration, and perception; developing a better sense of urgency when reading; interpreting more words in less time; working around inner speech, vocalizations, and regression; and learning how to skim. I am now applying these techniques and I can definitely see better results when it comes to my reading."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Liked the idea of the agency and the intermingling of past and current agents .  Would like to see all three of them working together sometime. A feel good short story is always a refreshing change.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"OMG!!!!!  Where can I find a teacher like her? I must say, she loves her students. As they say, A for Apple."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What a delightful short story this is! Just what I needed - a feel good, romantic, Christmas story.

The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)

This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.

Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?

The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.

The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.

My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?

All in all a great short read which left me with a huge smile on my face when I finished it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,She does it again. She has a way of writing that I felt the characters were real. We hate the mean people and love the innocent and good characters. I loved the consequences to all the characters in the story. She always has romance and tragedy woven  in her stories.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review. That does not change my review or rating on this book.

I really enjoyed the story of Derrick and Jade. I liked the friends to lover's concept and the characters were interesting. The love scenes were well written and hot.

I feel the story could have been expanded a bit between the middle and the end to better pull the story to a strong close.

Overall, I would recommend this book for a short, steamy read."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.

The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.

Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!

Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I really enjoy TB Markinson's books, so I jumped at the chance to get a free copy of the first two episodes of Girl Love Happens in exchange for an honest review. Girl Love Happens is definitely more erotica than her previous books, but I enjoyed seeing Gemma and Tegan jump into first love with all the excitement, suspense, and wild emotions that go along with it. I always enjoy the characters that Ms. Markinson creates, and the fact that they are not simple characters. Even though we've only gotten to meet these two and their social circle, I feel as though I've gotten a good picture of each person. I also love that this is a serial story, and that we get it in bits and pieces rather than all at once. I cannot wait to see what happens next!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received an ARC for an honest review. This was a great story and I love that I was able to read all 6 parts together. It would have been painful to have to wait in between!  The story was really involved with politics playing a major role and a tenuous treaty between shifters and humans hanging in the balance. Avelyn grew up in a school for girls dedicated to become mates for shifters. Each girl was assigned to a category of shifter, Fox, wolf, bear, Dragon, eagle. Evelyn was to be a Fox bride but she sabotaged herself by pretending to learn nothing and getting fat and failing interviews with prospective grooms. All she wanted was freedom. She was 3 months away from total freedom when Max Blackmane, Alpha werewolf, came to the school looking to buy a wife. Instead of a wolf bride, he chose the sassy Avelyn, who tried her best to fail,  even trying to run away. But they go to his home together where she feels trapped, unloved, frantic to leave. He is very patient with her and loves her spirit. But he hides something from her that may be his undoing and bring about the downfall of his clan. Evelyn cannot bear injustice and unfairness, so she will go against even her growing feelings for Max to see fairness done. Thus begins a time of terror for the Blackmane family, clan, surrounding villages, Europe, Avelyn's old school, possibly the world as they know it! Got you hooked?? Well, read the book! Besides, Max is hot and the heat between he and Avelyn is steamy! Great book!!"
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"One word sums up the follow up to The School for Mysteries: A Cozy Paranormal Adventure (Nurse Phoebe Book 2) and that is ""disappointment"". The predecessor was such a fun and exciting read in which the middle aged protagonist goes on a very wild adventure full of page turning thrills such as a heart stopping pursuit by unknown enemies, a murder attempt, etc. Even though that book's ending felt a little abrupt, I was still eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. If the last book fell short in the ending, this follow up more than compensates by having too much filler on the history and descriptions of French castles and its prior inhabitants. It felt as though Ms. Jourdan was promoting French tourism instead of focusing on her characters. The book did not actually pick up pace until the half way mark and even then her nemesis was hardly developed as a character. I absolutely love Phoebe's character and hope that if Ms. Jourdan continues the series that she brings back the exciting energy of the previous book because this one fell flat."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I'm not much into paranormal, this this was great! It's all about shifters, those people who can shift from human into wolves and other creatures, with various powers.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Sweetest Taboo by author Harper Miller, is a stunning debut BDSM novel depicting a BWWM D/s interracial romance. Rick and micah's relationship is neither unrealistic to the lifestyle, nor is it unrealistic to a fairytale or whirlwind romance you might hear about over brunch with your friends  and author Harper Miller's deft turn with the pin (mesmeric, though?) is certainly a refreshing addition to the IR/MC genre. Specifically, I really appreciate the intense amount of effort that went into both the packaging as well as the research  the cover is stunning (I want to be micah, and I want to be with Rick) and the very skillful editing. No spoilers here, but I hope that this author has an extremely bright future, and I look forward to reading many, many more of her books. Great craft!

This just makes her madder, but she will have to return later. Read this exciting new story to find out what happens. I hope you enjoy burnt Ppl as much as I did."

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased the eight volume set but I am reviewing each volume separately.

Porter Rockwell was a real Mormon lawman and enforcer for the LDS.  A member of the famous or infamous Danite order founded to protect the LDS, Rockwell is a controversial figure in the History of the West.  Author Michael Newton delves into this and some Mormon history as the novel progresses.  How accurate that history is, I am not sure.  It fits generally with what I know but I don't know specifics of Mormon history and don't have enough interest in it to research all of the details in this novel.  Accurate or inaccurate history aside, the story is exciting, easy to read and a good western tale.  Although some of the writing is a little sloppy.  For instance:  ""Striped trousers below, with shoes on small feet polished to a gleaming shine."". Polished feet huh?
In addition some of the geography and phytogeography seems a little off."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue."

Then theres Gloria who definitely garnered sympathy...and their stories are woven in a fascinating way.  And in the end the triumph over all of the nastiness that their husband created.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What woman wouldn't want five gorgeous, intelligent men focused strictly on her pleasure? We should all be so lucky! These characters are so well written you start falling in love with them immediately.  This story is sensuous, sexy and erotic. Savannah grew up under the rule of an emotionless, iron fisted father. No wonder the woman is still a virgin at 30 something.  Matt is dominant without being domineering.  He's shown her in a hundred different ways how he loves her. How did she miss the signs?

Looking forward to read each of the Wunderkind stories. Such unique personalities that we've only been given a glimpse of."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This is my first book by this author and I loved it. cant wait to read her next book. the Jerra and Darrell storyline was so emotional and sexy all at the same time.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Fortunately the relationship with my wife has been great so far, but I am sure all the things I have learned in this little book will help me if some marriage problems arise. The book might be short, but to me, every paragraph contains valuable info. I totally agreed with the 5 phases of the relationship and I think I learned a lot about the human Psychology regarding attraction and the search for a life partner. This guide would have helped me a lot in high school days. :)

Overall I recommend downloading this book. I think the author has done a good job."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Just finished ""Big Rock"" by Lauren Blakely. She writes steamy romance with a twist -many of her characters are funny.  Charlotte & Spencer are the main characters of this story. They are best friends and business partners. The introduction may be similar to many other romances but that is where the similarities stop! The rest is entertaining, funny, sentimental and yes, hot! Lauren Blakely knows how to deliver in the romance department! I really enjoyed this book."
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,The story was ok at best you really should edit! The words in this book that were misspelled and words that shouldn't been in the sentence. Autocorrect while reading through this book is not what the reader wants to do. The book was boring the female lead character I really wanted to shoot her after the first chapter.
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"The author tried to make the mystery/romance novel cute, but I could not really get into the book. Would not really recommend."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This book starts out as many romance novels do.  We are introduced to a struggling heroine who has been abused in past relationships and struggles to find love.  The hero is a jerk who we are meant to dislike, but I found him even more irritating then most.  About three chapters in, I was totally bored and almost didn't finish it.

But, as a person who hates leaving a book unread, I did read it all the way through.  As I got more into the story, I become more attached to the characters as they work toward overcoming whom they were to become who they do.  I am glad I finished it.  I did enjoy the story, but I really didn't crave it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Great Series.  I cannot wait for the third installment.  Very well written and once I started reading I could not put down.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a second novel I've read from Colleen Collins, and again she delivers with a 'big bang'. The hero is an attorney, heroine a private eye. At one time, she was his law firm's private investigator, but after stepping into the legal-gray-area one too many times, he put her on probation with a stern warning that one more slip-up, she's out. What he doesn't know is that her ""questionable"" investigation uncovered a growing sinkhole in his personal life, one that could destroy his world...something he learns too late. And then what is the next right thing to do? A question both of them face.
Suspense and right ingredients of the romance pushes this well written novel to the top of my list of the titles at the moment. Highly recommended."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ricky Cooper Designated Infected is a awesome read. He takes us from one end of the emotional scope to the other.
The story is fast paced and you never know what's going to be thrown at you next.  The story grabs you from page one to leaving you begging for more on the last. There is a little bit of everything tossed in and something that each type of Zombie lover can find appealing.
Wtg, can't wait for the next one to come out."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Wow Allie Juliette Mousseau has done an amazing job again. This book can be read as a stand-alone! At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?
I would have to say if you have any problems with violence both physical and sexual this book could trigger your own dreams, but that being said I would recommend this book to others and I for one can not wait to read more about these brothers!!"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"**Copy received in return for an honest review**
This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"At last, some honest, no nonsense advice on toddler sleep issues. Getting babies and toddlers to sleep through the night can be one of the biggest challenges for parents.
Not many parents are aware that young children can be trained to sleep well. This book will show you step by step how to do this and will work on both newborns and older children with sleep problems.
The advice in this book can also be used for all aspects of toddler behaviour - highly recommended!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I read Stuck in the Middle and loved it.  I was so happy to start this second book in this series and loved it just as much, if not more, than the first book.  The characters and relationships are so real and something most of us can relate to in one way or another.  Each family member and the rest of the characters were interesting and fun to get to know.  I really enjoyed this book and Im on my way to starting the 3rd book in this series.  I wish there were more!!!!!  It was a nice, clean and sometimes funny story I was so happy to have found.  Thank you Virginia Smith for writing  a super nice series!!!!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book will help those who have problems in living effectively and productively. It shows not only how to manage your time each day but also how to sort out your priorities, how to get organised and to eliminate fear of missing deadlines and avoid biting off more than you can chew, how, when making promises, to stay within what you can achieve. The true value of this book, though, lies in forcing you not only to plan and control commitments but even more importantly to manage interruptions, disruptions and other factors which eat up time wastefully. An interesting section deals with Time Management as being a state of mind, a training of personality.
 By following the advice given in this book you will be well on your way to becoming an organised and dynamic person without sacrificing quality time for family and friends."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Fast Diet is the best weight loss book I have read in a very long time. It has a practical approach and it is not full of unrealistic goals that are impossible to keep, like most of the diet books out there. I have been searching for the diet to work for me and after a lot of books with unrealistic methods and goals, I have finally found one that I believe will work for me. I showed my mom this book and this is the same weight loss approach that she has been using and she has been losing weight very steadily. I'm so excited to start. With no major holidays coming up, I'm going to start immediately. Another thing I really liked about the book is how the author tells more about herself and her life than just the diet period. It makes it so much easier to relate to. The cute pictures were just an added bonus. I loved it and will share it with my friends and family. If you haven't gotten it yet..... What are you waiting for. Get on the road of being the you that want to be."

Unlike much of the prepper fiction I read, this author distinguishes himself with proper grammar and tense usage and good vocabulary usage. Can't wait for volume 3!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This series keeps getting better and better. I would say this one can be read as a stand alone, since no story lines overlap and there are no characters from the first story included in this one. At the beginning I disliked Kirk as much as TJ, but Rain Carrignton has a way redeeming the characters and make you fall in love with them. He saved Malcolm and gave him a better life, despite the unconventional beginning to their relationship. My heart was breaking for Malcolm and the hand that he was dealt in life, but he surprised me by showing his strength and actually becoming the hero in various ocassions. The love of the biker brothers was beautiful to witness when they all came together for one of their own. Can't wait for Sammy's story, because he needs his HEA."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"It all starts with teenage dreams, heartache and ends with trying to be the good girl and marry the man her father has chosen.  I really could relate to Abby.  I think there are a lot of us out there that feel the pressure to do what a parent wants when what our heart desires is something else.  I was so glad to see that Abby returned and was not able to let her dream of being with Joe end without giving it one more try.
This is a sweet, moving short story about finally being able to come home to the love you thought was lost.

Ill be honest and say I wanted to see him have a pay back moment for all he has done to AJ.  We get some of that, I still felt bad for him though. His actions were awful but, he was broken.  Mackenzie was broken in other ways. I felt for her. They had an emotional journey. One that was worth it in the end.

This was an amazing continuation to the Levi and Nix's story that we begin in Body, Ink and Soul. This book picks up right where that book ended so we don't miss a beat (and if you remember the cliffhanger that book ended on you are going to be really glad the author made it a smooth transition!) this book has a few more difficult moments in it and it helps strengthen the love story. As they say in the book ""you have seen me at my best and now you've seen me at my worst"" and this story is a good example of love truly conquering all! We see all of our favorite characters from book 1 and get caught up on what is going on in their lives. I could see where there might be more books in this series because there are some relationships that beg to be explored!

There are plenty of the same tingles and warm fuzzies that the first book brought about which sometimes doesn't happen in a direct continuation novel but I was pleased to note that the same magic I discovered in book 1 was present and maybe even stronger as we see the next chapter in Levi and Nix's story. I thought this was a absolutely adorable novel! It's a must have along with Body, Ink and Soul on my purchase a print copy list!"
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This book was raw with emotion from page 1 and starts from after that awful day that changed Diana from the carefree person she was to a person who struggles daily with demons.  You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all of his own demons he fought the hardest for Diana.

We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.

As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.  He is also trying to deal with the fact that he was unable to save her.  Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.

Gideon and Dianas relationship continues to grow, helps both of them heal with the aftermath of that day.  In the end they both were each others saviors."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Being the second part to this duet I can't go into to much detail because it would ruin book one but I will tell you how this book made me feel...... it made me feel everything!

We meet a few new characters and I loved them all! Some we see more then others but the way they are in this book, they play a big role. We get to see a few from the old book that make you angry and some make you some.

This one picked up where the last book left off and omg it was such a wild ride. Finishing it at 1am my time, it was one of those books I couldn't put off reading because I had to know how they ended. Did they get their happy ending? That was my main question and I got my answer. While how it ended threw me for a loop, I was ok that that ending.

Overall, the author did an amazing job at keeping me invested in these characters lives. That's a huge plus in the writing world where there are so many books being released. I would like to see full books of atleast one of the secondary characters but I don't think that's going to happen. But a girl can dream. So if you want something dark ambit totally swoonworthy then meet Madden Decker! He is up high on my list of book boyfriends. This book does have a lot of fought subjects, just like the first, but I promise the ride is worth it! 5 stars #2OCCJD"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Going Against Type by Sharon Black (click here for Author Wednesday guest post) went toward my type of delightful light-hearted contemporary romance set in Dublin, Ireland. The genre hearkens back to the 1950s with mismatched lovers such as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, albeit with Irish eyes and tastes.

Charlotte ""Charlie"" Regan yearns to find her place in a world dominated by men as a sports' reporter and columnist. The hero of the story also fights for his place in the world of fashion writing where men are in short supply. It doesn't help matters that they work for harshly competitive newspapers and somehow find themselves pitted against one another when Charlie steps into the world of fashion by criticizing the footballers of Ireland for advertising popular name brands.

The novel reverberates with authenticity of the life of a journalist always under pressure to be fast, accurate, and edgy. Ms. Black, herself a journalist, paints a realistic picture of both Charlie and Derry despite their opposite views. I liked the twist in the story that turned stereotypes on end. It reminded me a bit of the movie with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, You've Got Mail. For most of the novel, neither Charlie nor Derry know the other one is the author behind the viperous attacks in the two rival columns written anonymously. In the meantime, they begin dating, enjoying their time together more each time.

If you want to escape for a few hours into the world of Irish football, fashion, and foibles, you won't be disappointed with Going Against Type. I think it's the first Irish novel I've read that wasn't historical, which makes it both refreshing and light."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Caroline Andrews and Josh Summers were the match that I was looking for in this series. They had different reasons for needing a second shot. Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This was a cute story. Unusual storyline for a romance, but I enjoyed it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book is basically a continuous of book one. It pretty much picks up where book one ended. The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide.

In this book I was able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.

Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.

Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.

I cannot wait till the next one comes out if their is a next one that is. I enjoyed getting to know these two couples and hope to read more about them in the future."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Two wonderful short stories of love and magic at Christmas. I especially loved the twins who ask Santa for ""The Mom."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Elsie is one spitfire and she has the love of the Dragon  king's personal guard.  Their romance is hilarious and very public although they try to hide it. Dragon love prevails and with it comes dragon wars, not to mention doom and gloom for the continuation of the human race. The family connections were easily traceable in this book, and it was nice to reconnect with Lara and her husbands (Nero & Dane), her son and grand-kids. King Darius is one cool King, wish our leaders today could be more like him.  Good read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Bianca Sommerland never disappoints.  Danger and hot steamy guys and their exploits are a win. How one girl can get two guys to change for her are just plain tough and sexy.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The hero of this novella was perfect.  He was romantic, masculine, loving, etc. and so I read this story mostly to get to his happily ever after.  The heroine was annoying.  I'm a little tired of the cliche storyline where the woman doesn't want to get involved with cop/firefighter/generic hero because of the possibility of future loss.  It's a bit over the top and has been done many times over.  My biggest issue with the heroine is that she would leave her husband without any explanation.  Who would do that?  And why would he want her back.  But, this is a romance so the play acting that they have to do in front of the heroine's family is funny and there is a happily ever after."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Through the twists, turns, and love affairs....I love this sequel! It's like all of these perfect not so perfect relationships but real love and happiness creeps up on everyone except ......."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What a wonderful way to get familiar with this Autbor!! There were a few typo/errors in the books, but I loved the characters so much!!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Ms. Toon is an amazing story teller.  Whenever I read her books I know I won't be bored.  In fact, I was reading another book but stopped to read this one when an email alerted me that it was now available for purchase.

She did not disappoint.  Don't let the fact that it is a YA book deter you.  It is still a wonderful story that kept me engaged.  I read it in less than 24 hours.

I really enjoyed Jessie's story and her coming to terms with her mother's death and finding out her biological father is a rock star.  I'll never be in that exact situation but it was fun and full of drama but still realistic and down to earth if that makes sense.  It was easy to relate to Jessie.  It was also fun catching up with Meg and Johnny.

I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars because I do feel that some of situations in the book were a bit mature for younger audiences.  There is drinking, and smoking.  *spoiler alert* The characters don't go further than kissing but I feel that some terms used were a bit mature.  That's probably just me though.

Overall, wonderful story I know I will probably reread."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Love the main character. I wish we got an explanation of the voice inside her head. Her relationship with Ryan is what makes this book great.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Received this for an honest review...Tanner is amazing to me. He is giving Natalie intimacy when he said he didn't know how. I love how Natalie is finding out about herself. She is exploring her own desires and sexuality as a woman. You should not be embarrassed about your sexuality and any fantasies that you have and by the end of this book, I think she came to terms with that. Tanner of course helps her with her self discovery. Her passion excites him and it just brings them closer together. Can't wait for the next one. Only two left. I'll be sad when it ends. Have enjoyed the journey with Tanner and Natalie!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Each of the books had its own flair and kept me thoroughly engrossed. I enjoyed the variety of characters and story lines.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The way Cassie and Andrei's relationship developed was believable. However, the chemistry between them and their connection was palpable. They meet when Cassie was being auction by her own parents. My heart went out for her!

Andrei in the other hand had always live in the middle of the violence and dangerous situations working for the Russian Mafia, but there was something that make him help Cassie.

The plot and storyline are well-written. The story is fast-paced, action packed, intriguing and captivating. The rest of characters were likeable, and memorable.

This is a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Mafia/ Organized Crime Genre. Sold to the Hitman is an absolute wild ride. Alexis Abbott ha become one of my favourite authors. I've been following her since her very first Mafia/Organized Crime series, and will continue to do so.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Katie was happy to be marrying her fiancee Darren in few weeks,but tragedy hits them both when they have an accident that ends with Katie not being able to walk.

As she struggles, Darren is torn between staying with her and furthering his career in politics. This where their love takes a turn. Will they stay together or will their paths go in different directions?

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"ARC received for review

Oh yeah, another great Cold Fury book. Ryker was amazing and so wonderful not only with his daughters but with Gray. I was expecting her to be a little harder and was pleasantly surprised that she was not. I loved seeing all the old crew hanging out together. I loved all of Zack's attempts at proposing. I can't wait to see who's up next."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I really tried to like this series. I've read, well quickly skimmed through all the books so far. I won't continue to read anymore. I really felt the story as a whole was just incredibly boring and instead of smart, courageous women we get bratty, careless teenage girls trying to rebel. The dialogue did not reflect adult conversations at all. Plus all 3 books are boring, the thing is these could really be great stories if some effort was put into it. Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the stories even worse. The potential is there for a good action packed sci fi romance but I think the author needs to write adult women into the roles not teen girls...and they're crappy teen girls at that. I've given this author 3 tries, I won't read anything from her again."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I was looking forward to this book and it did not disappoint.  My only issue is the making deals with Beauregard.  I don't understand why Eddie did and now why pony boy did. I assume it will work out in another story, but still it's annoying and the reason it is four instead of five stars."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For lack of cliche's I'll say this one is a nailbiter. Imagine being confronted with your certain death, but then given a chance to prolong or relive seven hours of your life. Dan gets this opportunity to beat certain fate and make it up with his presence, and it's a race against time to get what he intended within those seven hours.
Our time on earth is limited. We all die at some point, and Mike Dellosso wakes you up to the fact of this limit of life. Once you grasp that, he paints a story that it's not what's behind you that counts, its about being intentional and forward thinking to the relationships that matter most in each precious moment we are granted here that matters. And once you realize this in the story, the pages turn very quickly as you hope against each obstacle Mike writes to see if Dan can get it done.
Despite your best guessing you won't predict the end, but it will leave you choked up and reconsidering your seven hours left. Even though you don't know when Thomas Constant sets your timer.
Time is ticking...."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I enjoy this author immensely.  The stories are great and enjoyable. I like how incorporates people coming to Christ and demonstration for the need of prayer.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This series just gets better and better. Outstanding characters, vivid descriptions, great action in every book.
Buy this series and you won't read anything else until you have caught up."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,3rd book in the series 2nd in the Rick/Jordan saga. Rick is still an incredibly manipulative Jerk and his friends as well as Jordy continue to give him a pass. I feel that Jordy is too much of an enabler and allows Rick to manipulate him.there is a bit of growth at the very end of this part of the story. Hope to see more in the next.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I never get tired of reading anything about Sophie and Lucien. This home for the holidays story and we travel home to Norway for this little nugget, does does not disappoint. Lucien is up to his usual dirty antics, and as delicious as ever. Sophie understands and goes along, the result is a fast paced, easy fun, very sexy read with a touch of sentimentality."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What a surprise S E Smith gave us for Christmas!  I only knew about this for the last month or so from the hints on her FB page.  I started this Christmas morning before everyone got up, had to wait until after the day's festivities to pick it up again.  I couldn't put it down until I had finished.  Loved the story and Rune. What a great main character for this story. I never give out spoilers or rehash the books description.  That said even though it's in the Heaven sent series, it's not related to any of the characters in book one.  This story stands on its own.  Micha too was such an essential part of the story I thought even though he wasn't one of the main characters. Enough said - go read it!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Being in the dentist's chair is usually an uncomfortable and anxious place to be, but this story turns it around and puts the dentist on the spot. As he pokes and prods with his instruments, he is soon distracted by his patient's new accessory. The doctor has seen plenty of tongue rings but never one quite like this. It's very odd and makes him feel as if someone is watching him. As he continues his examination, he is soon troubled and scared by what he finds.

This story is maybe a fifteen-minute read, but it doesn't short-change the reader that feeling of expectation. There is a nice feeling of suspense for the reader as we wait to see exactly what the good doctor will discover in what is supposed to be a routine exam. From the well-chosen book cover with its unnerving stare to the patient's startling and ominous revelation, it all comes together for a good and kind of creepy read."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Once again Nathan McBride takes on the mission....all the while with the internal conflict of his past demons created by his career. The loyalty of his partner Harvey illustrates the brotherhood bond between the men. This is a continuation of the series of Nathan McBride, ending in a way unexpected. Just as excellent of a read as all those before. Descriptive, page turning, unable to put down."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I can't believe it! I've never met a D.B. Book that I didn't absolutely LOVE! This book ends on a HUGE cliffhanger but I can't wait to read the next in this series. OMFG! Garrett!! I really want to see how this all plays out. How long must I wait?!?!
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

Bring on the next enstallment!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very cute short Christmas story. The only issue I had was the crazy fast ending. Otherwise, good book."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Wonderful and intriguing story line. It was different and not dull and lifeless. Makes you want to read the entire series.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"An amazing story. You are carried right along with the characters. Experiencing every emotion with them. You laugh, cry, get upset etc.....  It is very, very realistic. Getting ready for the next installment.  I received this book from eBook Discovery in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,So I was shocked with the cliffy in part 3 and eager to see how that played out and who that was. WOW that's a twist I didn't expect. Alicia has some serious past issues and everyone is on high alert now with this new piece of info. On top of that Adam and Ace have somewhat resolved their issues and if they could just get Alicia on board it would be great. Ace and Alicia seem to be having the biggest issue BUT for a bit things get back to the sexy heat we crave and things seem to be smooth sailing. That is until Alicia does the math. Ace is now having less time to spend with them due to work and their surprise weekend ends this part with yet another cliffy.... I honestly DID NOT expect Ace to react how he did. I am a little let down with him. He seems to want the chances but never wants to give the benefit of the doubt to anyone else. We shall see if this new struggle smooths over easily or not.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book.  I have to say I was surprised that my attention was caught from the get go.

It was very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 years buried at sea.  When he was 'resurrected' he was thrown into the future and struggled to catch up.  His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in.

A few thing bugged me about this story.  The grammatical errors.  When Dom accused Palo as a 'trader'.  I think the word should have been 'traitor'.  So little things like that distracted me from the story a bit.

The author glossed over the transition period for Dom.  I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century.  I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth.

The sex described seemed to skip a few steps.  I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there was no writing direction, the reader has to assume what happens and where the positions of the characters are.  There were instances where I had to re read passages to see if I missed some things.

In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker.  The only lady he showed an interest in was a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of!  So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

But it was a good start and I am definitely curious enough to get the second book!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"If you're a meat lover, this is your book. Somehow I did not expect much at first glance but decided to preview it and ended up buying it. It did not disappoint. So many great recipes and meat combinations make this one a winner. Among the best meat recipes I've come across."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Another great short story/novella from Jasinda Wilder. This series is definitely worth the time and money. I highly recommend them.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"**3.5 stars**

I have a thing for time travel books. It started when I was a kid with A Wrinkle in Time and has continued throughout my adult life. I've read Outlander multiple times and practically hug it at night. I just find time travel love stories to unbearably romantic.

""Paradox Lost"" was a nicely done time travel story with some good romantic chemistry. I always enjoy Libby Drew's writing. She writes in a way that feels... easy. Her stories have a great flow to them and this one was no exception. I was hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book.

I had a few problems with some of the finer details of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and was supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it was irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic facts about the era that he was visiting. He kept trying to open things voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when things were invented.

Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 years and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that.

I tend to think of all of these details when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies.

Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day. A solid 3.5 star (aka between ""liked"" and ""really liked"") for me.

**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This one is about Samantha (Sammie), a woman who works for a sex magazine and wants to write an article about a man named Ryan (Dr Sex), who helps women get over their sexual hangups. She goes to one of his group therapy 3-day sessions under the guise of needing therapy. Little does she know that he is exactly the therapy she needs.

A very hot and thrilling story. Very creative story-line and loveable characters. I wish I was half as creative as this.

As usual, I highly recommend this K.M. Liss book, and I can't wait for part 2!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Great collection of recipes. Do we need anything else? Loved the photos too. Defiantly a keeper or great gift.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I was asked to review this book, and agreed. However, I found it so incredibly useful that I bought a copy so it can reside on my Kindle. Crosby and Dobbins have written a comprehensive overview that helps take your book from I've-written-a-book-now-what to a formatted and marketable product. There are few (if any?) books that address ebook marketing in such a comprehensive manner.

I found the sections on marketing the most useful. What makes this material (and all subjects in the book) so valuable is the many links to sites to help you learn more. Since I periodically use KDP Select for free days, the lists of sites to publicize free books was of special interest.

The authors operate a site called Kindle Book Promo. While it is mentioned when it relates to a topic, this book is not an advertising vehicle for the authors' services.

I highly recommend Advanced Kindle Book Marketing."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Book 3 picks up exactly where Book 2 left off. Lexi and Sloan have a lot to deal with. Sloan's ptsd episode causes a major break in the relationship and he no longer trusts himself with Lexi but she still trusts him but can't get him to listen to her. Book 3 was a kind of journey to self discovery for the characters both individually and together as a couple. Both Sloan and Lexi began therapy and they started to move on with life. They both had to deal with things from the past, including Victoria and Aaron. I was worried that they would not get the ending I felt they deserved but it all worked out in the end."

It is so much more than just a story and I cant wait to start the next book in the series."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I received this ARC from the publisher via netgally I got to say I enjoyed this book so much that I'm going to purchase the previous series that are connected with the Fireside Inn .

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is truly an original concept and the outcome of each of these contests are really unexpected. The game is getting more complicated and interesting. Both Jill and Nicky are important players that expertly contribute to the story line from their unique perspectives.

Another gripping book in the Girls Wearing Black series. A highly recommended series indeed!"

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Rebecca Royce adds her voice to this wonderful series with this book. I love returning to the world of the Black Hills Wolves. Each new story brings a new adventure.

 This book gives us the couple of Mags and Clay. When Mags returns to the pack to help her sister, Clay soon follows. She thought she could never have her mate but things soon change for Mags and Clay. I loved this couple and seeing their relationship take shape made for a nice read. The two are great together. Love is something that cannot be denied and the two face this fact and soon fight for it.

Not only do we get to watch a beautiful relationship develop but we also get to see the action and suspense with everyone trying to figure out and stop the killings. It was nice to see the other characters from past books and seeing how everyone interacts with one another.

 I enjoy how each author continues this story line but makes it their own without losing the feel of the series. I am pulled in and always want to return for more.

I received this book in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,This book was really sweet but quite predictable. I love mail order bride stories but it was never easy for these women and Emma's story made it look too easy even for fiction.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"There is no good way to review this book without giving the plot away and all I can say is that this is a extremely complex book with lots of twists and turns. There where times I did go out to Google to research some of the mythology mentioned in the book to round out the reading for my self-need but it is not necessary for the reader to do that in order to enjoy this book.

The author creates a very interesting world involving mythology and a large variety of complex characters drawing the reader deep into her fantasy world. Readers will be curious with the plaything, Damon and his story while wondering who he really is. As the story unwinds who he is becomes clearer and you will have that ""AH HA"" moment and feel at peace with him and his story.

Meanwhile Elysia, another aspect of this story, continues to draw your attention in another direction worth investigating. Elysia is a great example of how a woman would handle life threatening situations when there is no choice but to live. Her believable character will draw the reader closer with the desire to see her succeed and get her hearts desires.

Secondary characters are numerous and the reader will be able to tell that their stories were written in previous books to this series but this will not be a problem to reading this book.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This book is unusual to say the least. The beginning keeps you guessing for a while as strange events start to happen to Evie. You start to get little hints about what is happening until your teased with thoughts of the greek gods. What happens when the gods are threatened? well there is an unusual theory in this book. My curiosity kept me going and by the end I found myself really interested in what was going to happen to poor Evie. Is she going to make it? Will she come to terms with what is happening to her or will her mortal body fail? I guess I'm going to have to find out lol. There is explicit adult content and violence.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,A steamy good read. I enjoyed Evie and David's story.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've been sitting on this story, I know I needed to read it, already read Tying The Knot but I just couldn't make myself. I knew it was going to make me feel all the emotions and just needed to prepare myself for it! So what do I do?? Decide that 3 am is the perfect time to dive in, and yep I was swallowed by this story, it had me from page one, and now I'm laying here, just done....mega book hangover. Thalia and James, it was impossible for me to not love them and this twisty, turny story just gave me even more reasons. And yes, I cried like a baby and it was awesome! I know this was a short, no real info review but my mind is fried, this is the best you'll get! Just be ready for the impact this will have on your emotions, unless you're a heartless unromantic slug, LOL!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ms. Salam writes believable characters struggling through situations that could be drawn from current events, in this case the war on drugs."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Nice and well written story. Being from Chicago ms Black was on point with all the location in the city. I love a good ending.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Avery Flynn has a wonderful light and flirty touch in this fast-paced romance. The love-hate relationship of Keisha Jacobs and Gabe Campos is very sexy. His desire for revenge against her father adds drama  to their attraction. I enjoyed the colorful cast of characters. They are a lively bunch. The dialogue was very humorous and their romance very sensual. Keisha and Gabe are a unique couple who captured me from page one. I enjoyed their fight for a HEA. Betting the Billionaire left me smiling.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I thought I was well versed in American history until I read this book.  I had never heard of the sand creek massacre before I read this book.  Should be required reading in all history classes
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"There is alot to say about this part of story...first part let's just say Kitty Kat got her just deserts....All I can say about the conclusion was YAY
I love the last line that's my living with every day what marriage is perfect you have good and bad time though out your life's....oh nothing is perfect....
Thank you for a wonderful story of That Man !!!! "
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,Was Dee Henderson the author? far from her excellent O'Malley type style.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a really sweet and funny read. The first section, about a holiday tradition,  feels like a relaxing and hilarious conversation with a good friend. It's the perfect little story to get you smiling and considering the magic of Christmas."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,It's interesting but not sure how truthful it is & a lot of facts & dates wrong!! Not worth that much money!!
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,The power of love is the sweetest and craziest thing.  You never know what the reaction will be. Great story.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I enjoyed this sweet Amish novella and its wonderful characters.  This wholesome book clearly reflects strong Biblical values of purity, honesty, respect to elders, obedience, conflict resolution,  and more.  I enjoyed this as an adult and think it would be equally enjoyable for teen/young adult readers.  Danika, the main character, adapted easily to her new life in the Amish community.  I know it would be more of a struggle for me to give up all my modern conveniences and technology to live this simpler life style. This is the second book I have read in this Amish Girls Series and look forward to reading more in this series and by this author."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"If you love animals, love watching people fall in love, but also discover what it really means to live again after tragedy has struck"
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,It's a decent read though not the normal type of book I like to read. It's basically a book of short stories about the people who have found messages in a bottle& abbreviated versions of what the messages said.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"One Funeral continues on right where No Weddings ends. This time it's in Hannah's point of view. It takes you through Hannah's journey of getting through the pain of what her ex had done to her in the past and re-starts the build up of her relationship with Cade.
I tend to not read stories that about ongoing relationships, but something about how this story is written makes me want to hurry up and keep reading to see how it ends. I thought the authors did a tremendous job of completely creating two entirely different characters in Hannah and Cade. Having this story in Hannah's perspective, you feel her vulnerability as she moves through the story, something you don't really get in the first book as Cade doesn't really see her vulnerable side. This entire series is much like the characters' relationship, a nice slow burn that allows the relationship to build in a lasting way.
I can't wait to read the third book."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"First time user, glue last time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm a self-proclaimed"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"As a former Marine I know what I want to do.

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a bad run.  My running shoes are so great and I have to wear them all the time.  I was thinking about going with this as it would be a little more comfortable.

I did get a free item for review.

I will update if I find a better solution to the issue.  It may take a while to figure out how it works out, but I'm sure it will be a very helpful tool."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,I used this netting for a couple weeks with the stove set on a 4 person camp stove and we had a great time. I am using it for the colder months when it is not necessary to set up the stove in the basement. The poles are thin and compact. I would not recommend this netting as a net to keep things dry. I have not used it as a net but I do like the fact that it is made in the USA. I will buy another one
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,CG,Would probably give some good time to the seller. Very good quality. Nice bag. Works great. Great for emergencies. Easy to get around and use.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"Ok so I've seen a few of the other reviews saying that it's too small for my arms.

I had to get a size small and the shoulders are a bit large. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the fit and feel of this shirt. I am very happy with it and it will be a great addition to my collection.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but it's not too heavy. It's a good pistol, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It's bright and bright. I've had no problems with the battery, and the sight is great. I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB and other ride-hiking bikes.Works great for my husband.  He loves it.  He does not like it when he rides on the trails.  He will be buying more.This is the only bag I have ever used that"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"Good for the money, not what I expected. Not too hot or too cold."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"If you own a CZECH, you know you're going to have to pay a lot of money for a quality rifle. I am a 32 oz. Taurus II, and it's worth it.  It's a little thin, but it is very compact.  The rifle is a bit too small for a compact pistol, but the rifle is well built and well made.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a gun that will last a long time.I got this for my son's birthday, but he does not like it.  It is too big and too small and he is too young to use it.  He is not very creative and it is too hard to take to the range.  It is too big and too small for his hand.  He also does not like it.  It was too big for him and he is too small.  He does not like the fact that it is too small, but he does not like the fact that it is too large.  It is too big and it is too small.  He does not like it, but it is a good idea for him.  I bought two for our son's birthday.  They were both very nice and made of a durable material.  We bought a second for our son's birthday and both are well"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"As the other reviewer said, this is the only one you need to keep in your pack.  It is so small that it will not fit in the trunk or under the pants.  The only thing I would change is to make it a little wider.  Otherwise it is very comfortable.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a pack full of stuff.Great product!I use this to carry my iPhone 6s and it is very useful. I have a very small hand and it is"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I seldom give 5 stars, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the starter kit."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,Easy use for quick weight adjustments. The only downside is that it comes with a small screw driver.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"While I do most of my running, I'd say I'm not going to be using the extra weight from the floor. I am using the extra weight to keep the legs strong and straight. The extra weight is in the way of the legs. This is why I ordered the full size instead of the 8"" version. I had to order a second size so I could use it when I run with the legs bent over and on. I like that the legs are longer than the 8"" version. I have a small belly and I feel that the extra weight makes it a bit heavier. I would have liked to have been able to do that. I had some other reviews and they said the extra weight made it easier to hold my arms in the arm position. I have to say the extra weight is nice. I haven't had any problems with this on my bench."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,CG,"I love tek lok and this has kept me cool in the cold weather for a couple of weeks. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for his golfing and fishing trips for about two years now. He loves the texture and it's easy to clean and it has a very soft feel to it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,CG,"I ordered a size 10, and it fits perfectly.  I will be purchasing a size 11, and will be ordering a size 12, as well.  I think the XXL is a bit small for me, but it's perfect for me.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,Snagged this coat for about $200 and it's comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small but the shoulders are nice and strong. The only thing I would change is the size of the hat. I like the snug fit and the texture of the shirt.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I bought one of these for my husband. He loves them. He loves the way he can get a grip on the gun, and they're light and easy to take off and on. I'll be purchasing more in the future. I love these socks."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"Fit my hardgun perfectly. Not an easy task, but I will keep my pistols in the house. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his gun very well. The straps are very tight, and it is very easy to slide on and off. I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it off. The included pockets are nice and easy to store. This holster is super comfortable and fits like a glove, and it has a nice, thick, and comfortable grip. I would definitely recommend this to any shooter. Very good product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I did not buy this for an emergency emergency kit. I did not need it for a full-on fire.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint is that the cover is very thick.  This is a problem for most people.  I will have to order another one.  I will update this review if I ever need to use this item again.I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house. The netting was very nice and easy to install. I was able to keep it and put it in my closet without it getting in the way of my work. The netting is very sturdy and I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it and do not want it to get in the way of your work. My only negative would be that it does not have a vent that can be used for air. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to keep their rifle and shotgun in the bag.I have been using this for a few months now and I have been very happy with it. It is easy to set up and I can use it on my back porch. It is very comfortable and I like it. I would recommend this product to anyone.I use this daily for my small water bottle. I use it for my air mattress. It works well for my water bottle. It is a nice little thing to have.This is the best"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"This unit was very easy to assemble and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very fragile.  The material is not durable, so it will be hard for you to put it"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I have some iron dumbbells that have the iron chain in them.  These have the iron chain in them so they don't get stuck.  The ring is a little too loose and the chain is too loose.  The next time I use them I will see if they would work.  They work great for the purpose.  I can't wait to use them.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time,"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,Used for about a year now. The only problem is that it's not really a mesh one.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"This seat is large and comfortable. The only problem is that it comes with a small buckle that is a little too tight. I am not sure how the buckle is made, but it is definitely not a problem.

If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely consider this. I have a large frame and I can't imagine having to carry a heavier vehicle. I just can't imagine having to carry it"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"For the money, this is a great addition to my AR-15.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and doesn't seem to hold the sight securely in place"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"Much more comfortable than the old ones, the materials are thick enough to make a comfortable pad, and the seams are very comfortable. The stitching is also very good, and it is made of quality material. It is a good value for the price. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very pleased with the quality and it is a great gift."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,I am having trouble getting it to open. I've tried a lot of different levers and the bottom is not the best.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"It doesn't replace hand signals, but it does let you know if it's important to you.

I tested it out in the woods and it works great. It's great for holding a flashlight and a couple of spare batteries in a backpack. If you're looking for a good flashlight with enough power to keep a few feet away, this is the flashlight you want. It has a very nice built in flashlight with a red LED flash and two LED's. It's very bright. The light is very bright"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,CG,"I like the size, design, and the fact that it has a zipper that opens the top and closes the bottom. The front zipper is also designed to be tight so it doesn't slip down. It's not waterproof so it will be hard for water to get in. I haven't used it with a rain jacket, but I'll try it with a rain jacket. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. I like that it's not expensive, and that it's made in the USA."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,For the price this knife is an amazing deal.  I will keep this knife in my collection.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,CG,"So, this is the second time I have used it. I did not need to purchase a full sized (or extra large) bag, but I figured if I wanted to take it on a trip, I would. It is a perfect size for my needs and I can carry it for the day. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do. The other review I have read said the handle is too small. I was worried this might be because the handle is so small, but it is not. It is a bit too thick for my liking. I would recommend to others if you are using a different handle for it. I was able to find some great reviews from others who said they were able to use this for some serious activity. I have not tried this handle yet, but I hope to. I have a 5 year old and this is the handle I would recommend to her. She has no problems with it. I would recommend this for anyone. I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", 170lbs. She loves it and has had it for about a year. She has been using it a lot and is happy with it. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is the color of the logo."

It's very comfortable to wear and very comfortable to wear.  The sleeve is very comfortable and comfortable to wear.  I'm sure it will last a long time.  The zipper is very soft and it makes it easy to pull on and off and to change the colors.  It's a very nice design for a camping vest.  It's light weight and very comfortable.

The pack is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built. It has a nice, high quality strap that is very easy to attach and remove. The sleeve is very comfortable and I like that it does not have any pockets for my phone, which is a plus.

I am also very happy with the sizing of the pack, as I am very confident that this will be a very good fit for me. I am a tall woman, and I am normally 5'6"", about 200 lbs.

The bike is pretty small, so he doesn't really have a lot of room for it, but it fits a little snug. I like that it has a couple of pockets on top. It has a lot of grip on the handle bars, which makes it easy to carry around. It has a few small pocket pockets, which also makes it easy to keep in the bike.

Overall, this bike is pretty good. It does not have the rust of a lot of bikes, but it does have a nice handle bar.

The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands."

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me. It looks like the good matches, but these are flimsy, inconsistent and unreliable."

It's fantastically light, affordable and the color is super bright.

Highly recommended, if this is your thing."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I bought 3 of these. Took them out on the boat for the first time tonight. Two of the three broke within an hour. Still got the the fish in the boat, but I only came home with one. Sooooo be advised, they're pretty weak for bass fishing, but for a spincast reel and some light fishing for crappie or something they're probably fine. I don't blame Quantum. I blame my mantra. ""Set it like you got a pair"""
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,I think depending on a few factors the amount of pressure in these sprays is inconsistent. Between my training partner and me we have four from this company and this style. I have a pink and one in black. He has both in black. Each one had had different strength of pressure. We still carry them for loose dog situations but quality control seems not top notch.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Very pleased....I have been using the straw Camelbak for the last 7 years and the last couple I bought broke in some way or another or leaked so I switched to this one and just received it a few days ago and I like it a lot.  Very sturdy, does not leak, keeps water cold"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great fanny pack for men and women For running and working out or just for a convenient way to hold your Loot! I have to say that the one thing I miss most about the 80 is definitely Fannypack's. That said, it is hard to find one that is useful and stylish. I got this in the orange color and love it. It has a lightweight nylon like fabric and looks great and very durable. I don't care what anyone says  the convenience of a  Fannypack far outweighs the fashion benefits of even my most user-friendly  and functional purse!
The Zippers are heavy duty and nothing about it feels cheap so I expect to be using this for a long time  as it has a great high-quality feel to it.
I received this at a discount so that I can try it out and offer her my honest and unbiased opinion and review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"These were my size but too baggy on my legs and a little too long overall. They were tight on my butt and loose at the waist, so I could not size down. Besides the sizing issues, the shorts were very comfortable. I would not wear these out, but just indoors due to sizing issues."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Im a lifter and I keep a chalk ball in my bag. I use this religiously when I deadlift. Great for keeping my chalk. I also get compliments on it all the time.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I purchased a complete set from Biolite two weeks ago. It arrived missing a critical pot adapter for small pot and pan use. In addition, while I waited for THE FIRM to fill the backorder for the stove and bundle purchased directly from them, they dropped the price by $30 but did NOT credit or adjust my costs billed to me. Nothing, absolutely silent on all fronts.

Now for the real bad stuff. The firm has no phone number. I created 5 very nice email over a two week period to them to various email addresses I could find. NOT ONE response. I went to Facebook and reached out to their social media host. No replies what so over.

I went to their site and tried to register the products purchased from them, but received no validation check on warranty registration once I thought it was completed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioLite-Wood-Burning-Campstove/dp/B00BQHET9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioLite Wood Burning Campstove</a>

I have NEVER purchased a product/solution from a U.S. company that was completely non responsive after purchase.

I am a very nice person, and was kind in my communications to their departments, requesting support, until my most recent one (#5).

Pathetic company, ridiculous operation. So so product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Bought this a while ago. Sorry for the late review. This is a great flask. Keeps it ice cold all day.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These are very nice to attach to your paracord bracelet as a backup to your primary tools. Compass is fairly accurate and the firestarter and light both work quite well. I have several of these and they all are quality tools. A few of the firestarters have a tendency to fall out due to a manufacturing issue. All you have to do is call CRKT and ask for parts department. They are very friendly and will ship out a replacement quickly. I got one in two days.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,This is a very high-quality lubricant but it is a pain in the neck that the surface you're applying it to has to be warm/hot in order to use the product effectively. Because of this hindrance in regard to effort and time I won't be purchasing this again.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This gets hot enough to make authentic brick oven style pizze. I also bought the 60, 000 btu double burner camp stove by the same company to put underneath it, but since I have to turn it down quite a bit to get the proper temp for this oven (around 800 degrees), you could probably make due with the 30,000 btu unit.
The combined price for both oven and stove is around $300, a great price for a pizza oven."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,I like the product it is pretty sturdy it works well on the carpet but the portion for the hardwood floor doesn't slide as much as you would want
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These socks are very comfortable sock to wear, maybe not as light and thin as drymax, but if you want a sock that has some cushion and comfortable this style are a great choice."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"smaller than I was expecting, but well made for the cost."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This bolster has kept its shape for a couple years now! Very happy with this product.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Very nice material and great fit.  These were made to the level of quality I have come to expect from Adidas.  Material is soft, yet the weave is such it does greatly reduce the ""wind feel"" against your body.  Only drawback is they do not have ankle zippers which make it easier to remove pants over tennis shoes.  I wear a size 11 tennis shoe and the bottom of the material is stretchy enough to get them over the shoe, but the zipper would have been better--unfortunately, nothing in the description or pictures allows for this insight!  I'm happy!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Good quality construction and very inexpensive.  My wife and I use these carabiners to clip accessories onto our backpacks and daypacks.  They are especially useful for securing compact umbrellas or water bottles to our small travel daypacks, should these items fall out of the pack pockets.  AND they are packaged with rings for use as key rings.  Do we need 20?  Perhaps not but these are cheaper than buying the 6 or 8 individual clips that we will regularly use."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I love this running vest.  It is perfectly adjustable.  It is bright and very easy to see in the evenings.  I am a runner, but even if I go out in the evenings to walk, I will wear this.  Our neighborhood is very safe, but not well lit.  Oncoming cars can easily see me when I wear this.  Such a great product.  I am thankful to have received this item at a reduced rate as a promotional item, and would gladly pay full price for it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I used it once and the foot strap already broke, I am really disappointed, I am a personal trainer and I was recommending it for my customer, so it's a shame the quality is really bad"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,Sizer die started scaring brass after about thirty rounds. Junk. Should have purchased RCBS or Redding dies. Contacted Lee and they wanted me to ship the die back and would not pay shipping. They said they would give me credit on my next purchase. Why would I want to purchase more junk?
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,i love this outfit it really keeps me warm and protected from the cold wind when walking and cycling. very nice material and it looks good with my fox racing gloves and helmet.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,If it weren't for the long time it takes to fill and the horrible aroma of chlorine bleach I would give them 5 stars instead of 4.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"My grandsons love to play with play doh. They make a huge mess with it and we end up having to clean up hardened play doh from everywhere. This kinetic sand gives them the same pleasure, but it stays soft and they can continue to use it. I also bought them the kit that comes with tools and 2 pounds of sand in a case. I bought this to add to it so both boys can play together, one on each side of the case. The sand mostly stays inside the case. The boys enjoy the feel of the sand. It is similar to building sand castles at the beach."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,So far they're great! No rips or tears after going a few rounds with them and hitting the bag!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This is really a well made rope and i have been practicing for double unders at home. Great price too. Packaged well and came on time.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Excellent holster - well made.  I did add some deerskin to the body side to make it more comfortable.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"easy to mount, spacious, light, one person can install it in 10 min, to me it fits to all cars, mine is a small honda civic and it simply fit into it"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"The price and comfortability of this mask were the 2 best things about it, which are 2 very important things to have in a mask. The negative, for me, was the fogginess. I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3. If that was not the case, I might be tempted for a 5 star review, but 4.5 is probably more accurate. Great feel, comfort, size, and price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this really for memories. I had one of the original ones carried it every where used it hunting pheasant in Michigan, hiking in the Sierras, motorcycling in the Yukon, and I wore it out. So I now carry it for the memories. and it. works too. Helps me to find my car in the lot."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,perfect fit and limits the amount of holes in my wall
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Precisely what was needed to make the Sigma a tactical hi-cap 9mm. I would recommend this to any of the people that have come to see the quality and value of the ""American Glock""."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,Always get water in them compared with other glasses that don't get water at all. Maybe they are good for kids not for adults. I recommend you other glasses.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,The pad does not self inflate sufficiently to make for comfortable sleep. After getting all the air out is impossible
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Very nice clear good mount easy to sight in fits and looks great
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"It takes a 10-15 minutes, and a bit of tech savvy, to setup the stations.
If this isn't an issue for you, it'll be an excellent addition to your outdoor activities (particularly mowing the lawn).  It appears to worthy of the 3M name.  Well made and packaged properly."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,10 yr really liked these.. excellent quality and fits right.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"these are mesh which wasn't what I was expecting, but I do like them non the less, they work good for keeping cool!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Good all a round bike especially for the price.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Perfect for storing ammo.  Very sturdy and the trays boxes are great for 5.56 rounds.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great paddle! Very light-weight and sturdy. It is much more easy to use than the paddle that came with my paddle board. It is also easy to adjust or take apart and even came with a great carrying case.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I liked this product because I was looking for something different as a gift. Chain is durable and the colors of the tag and bright and bold.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I have had two of these and they are waterproof and comfortable to wear.  Both of them lost function after four to six months.  The step counting is good if you wal and swing your arms, or if you run.  Slow walking, or pushing a cart will  not be picked up as steps."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Fits my G42 like a glove. Much easier to carry in this than the cheap nylon stuff.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Amazing product. Arrived on time and in good condition. This product is exactly as advertised. If you are looking for something like this then rest assured it is as it says it is. Very happy with purchase.

BUT the rear sight amour's tool used to take it off won't fit on any ghost sight. You have to hammer it on by hand. It only took a clamp on a wood work bench, a flat head punch set and a hamer."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,These work but not super easy to use and it may take more than a few to get the job done so on a dollar cost basis the are not very cheap. I can see the utility of them but I could also just see using a chamber brush too.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,The glue on the back of these things is crap. They don't stick to the wall... At least not for longer than a few hours.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,this is great  on my back  i put it on  wall  and  roll  it up and down  bending  my knees to small  for me  to lay on floor  to do  make sure before on wall  that it does not hurt your paint  on wall
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,If you need a 3way swivel then these are the ones. No tangles even in strong current. Can be used instead of tying a dropper loop.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,Not a big as described.  Says 49 inches in long but it won't fit a 44 inch waist.  Not for any big guys.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Great little air horn. However, I was disappointed with the construction quality. Although rated to 150 psi, the canister bottom buckled and bulged outward at only 75 psi. The unit was pressurized slowly using a hand-operated bicycle pump with a pressure gauge. It works fine, but I'm always concerned that it might rupture when I refill the canister."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"It's a ruler that lets you measure spokes, and it was cheap."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Great bottle, holds water, no leaks, love the ID pocket"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"They do what they say!  See the pictures:
Size right out of package
Each towel spread out
Large metal bowl
2 cups of water
1 towel absorbed most of it
2nd towel absorbed the rest of the 2 cups of water
Left no water in the bowl!
One thing I did notice is that when I wrung the towels out was that the water was blue tinted, so you may want to wash before using on your skin.
I hope this product opinion helps you make an educated decision on your purchase.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Purchased this scope to replace the 4x15 that came with my pellet gun.  For the price, this is a fantastic scope!  The only complaint, is like other reivews:  you can't focus on closer targets when using 7-9x power.  Other than that, I am very very happy with this scope."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great knife for heavy work around camp or around the yard.  A little heavy if you are packing in to camp somewhere but will handle about anything.  It took a good edge pretty easily....
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"If you're not afraid of showing some 'leg',  this is a great, minimal, running short.  Lightweight and comfortable.  Just what I was looking for."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Use it up very quickly... The background color shows up really well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I refuse to do hip thrust without this. It beats the yoga mat rolling or mat adjustment. Very nice for squats. I hate the Velcro pad that's pull my hair. If you like to focus on flutes and legs with a barbell this is a must!!!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I am going to buy it again when the size Med is available.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Very good knife,came very sharp,it is a solid heavy duty knife with a great price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have given my keys to SO many people strictly because the following statement: ""Hey man, you got a bottle opener?"" Yes, of course I do."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,My skinnier 10u girls can wear this with no problems.  Love that it accommodates the bigger girls too.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"The material is nice and soft. Definately NOT Squat Proof. I even ordered a size up (I's a 4/6 Lulu, Sm in Athleta, Sm in Nike) and the Med in these tights were SOOOO see thru. You could see the VS writing/logo on my panties. NO THANKS. I do feel they fit true to size and would stay with a Small"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Much improved over the ""light"" version which I also have. The lid works much better and I like the thicker gauge TI better. I actually bent my old lighter 550 ml pot while being jostled around in my bike pack. It is heavier at 100 grams vs 72 (old version) for pot plus lid."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.  I'm not wholly down on the gloves, but they are obviously really flimsy and apparently not intended to be warm."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"DID NOT FIT SIG 380, SIGHT CAUGHT ON END OF HOLSTER"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Not damn this thing is a good deal more gun case than I expected when I bought it. If I went boating I could chuck this thing in the water and tether it to me and it would all be fine on the other end. Tough as nails. Water PROOF, not resistant. Outstanding value."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I rolled my kayak coming in from the ocean to the beach and broke my existing paddle. I bought this one as a replacement and, for the price, wasn't expecting much. I am very happy with this. It not only comes apart, but is very sturdy and has the little grooves to bring yourself closer to a dock or other surface."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I was very happy how well it fit, glad I got 2."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Bought two more of the Stamina 1300 exercise bikes for aging family members.  Great, easy to use, bike that has features you can explain even to those that are not computer literate.  If you want a fancy bike, this isn't it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"It is a good addition to my hiking pack. Easy to use and reasonable light to carry. Only issue is when you lube the chain. It stinks up the backpack and soaks into the carrying bag, so I couldn't add it as is to my hiking/hunting backpack, since the criters can smile me a mile away. I did double bag the carrying case with zip loc bags, but it is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The design of this Poncho is better than U.S. Military issue: It has snaps that create sleeves for your arms making it easier to do things without the rain seeping in. However, it still functions well as a small tarp. The quality is good and it is very light weight and compact, even if the camo looks a little weird; after having for a while, I'm getting where I kind of like it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,They fit tightly and a little difficult to get on however they never fall off.  They look good and do the job well.  After they eventually wear out I will purchase the same product again.  Priced to sell also.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Fit true to size, definitely more of a 5mm width. Exactly what I was looking for - many of these silicone rings are very wide and do not look good on my hand. Haven't worn one to the gym yet, but they seem pretty durable.

Update: I always wear these to the gym now and they have held up very well. No signs on damage, and they are very comfortable while lifting weights."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These fire well and the price is perfect. Just be careful not to accidentally hit metal of shoot at too hard of wood. Remember it's only a plastic shaft.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This visor works great, and it has stood up to several machine washings already."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I owned several knives including Gerber, Buck, Smith and Wesson, and I've got to say, this Kershaw knife is a great surprise. The feel of this knife is so sturdy, I love the weight distribution and the solid, yet silky smooth action of the blade on its hinge. I can flip this knife open easily with a flick of my wrist due to its weight.

The steel is very interesting. I love the two types of steel fused together with copper...one stronger and harder to provide the a good base to attach the softer, more easily sharpened edge piece...I don't know how operationally effective it will turn out to be in the long run but the concept is great and so far I've had no problems.

WARNING: IF LEFT WITH MOISTURE THIS BLADE WILL RUST. DUE TO THE MATERIALS USED THE BLADE WILL DEVELOP RUST IF LEFT UN-OILED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN DAMP AREAS. IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY BE SURE TO STORE THE KNIFE WITH A LIGHT SHEEN OF OIL ON IT.

The above is mentioned in the knife manual that comes in the package but it is not mentioned in the product details, which it probably should be. Luckily I read the directions when they're provided so I will be able to prevent rust on this beautiful knife.

Highly recommended although I would imagine there are probably better knives to purchase if you are going to be abusing this knife. I just find it much too attractive of a knife to risk scratching, chipping, or scuffing it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,This are a great cheap way to protect your cards. If you are buying them for Legendary the deck building game I would say: be prepared for them to fit a little loose.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"At a glance upon arrival I was a little worried. The shorts were tiny but it turned out they were a good fit. The material isn't thin and weightless, but its' a solid material that is comfortable. I like how the shorts go down towards the knee. I received a discount on this product through Amazon Review Trader, and the deal made it all especially worth it. Also, the shipment came on time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Follow directions closely.  When used properly it assures a positive seal, patch, repair.  Can be used on neoprene, though its best suited for tri-lam drysuit repairs or to attach latex seals to a suit.  I save the cotol for in-field repairs when faster drying times are needed.  The working time is shortened when using this, so greater care must be taken in the repair."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Ordered for my husband, wish it was bi fold instead of tri-fold, but he uses it and doesn't complain."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Works very well, however, I did not expect plastic, but it seems to be holding up well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,does the job. the light is supper bright and it has different settings which is super cool. Got it on time and everything too
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Great  knife,  a good one to carry horizontal in my belt behind me,  You can get it quick,  in case of emergencys (maybe while hunting)....."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,These weights work just fine but Amazon shows a picture of a different more expensive set than what they send to you. They have a picture of a set of weights in a red plastic box that has 5 weights sitting in the foam rubber beside of the plastic box of smaller weights. What they sent was just the small box of weights. I could have bought this set of weights at Midwayusa.com and saved over $6. This is not the first time this has happened.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This was bought to replace a broken flip lid from the Hydro Flask (which I have to say is a fantastic product and probably the best flask we have used!). Anyway, thanks to high desert winds, the flask was blown off the table and cracked. This replacement fits just as the original does plus it's a more exciting colour than the boring black version that the original came with!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"This is a little larger than I expected. However, it fits well under the helmet and keeps my head warm. I do have a good bit of wind noise around the ears while wearing this item."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Definitely makes a difference having quality gear. The ST Croix Mojo Surf rod was amazing
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Blade doesn't lock into the open position easily, but what do you expect for 8 bucks."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,Would have been perfect but two tiles were damaged. Went to local hardware store to just replace the two and they were not compatible
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Well made. Nice and cool for walking or hiking. Size is right on.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Maybe if I had standard size carbon arrows this might work. However, I use Easton Gamegetter XX75's, a large diameter shaft (0.036in according to my digital caliper). This says it can go up to 0.3in, however, I disagree. I wish I had posted a picture to go along with this but I do not. The sticky rubber holders were stretched too much that it made it really difficult to get the arrows secure. But the main problem was that the rubber would actually push a couple, not all, of the arrows out after a short period of time (~1-3 minutes). This would result in lost arrows while hunting. I had to return this. Still looking for a replacement....

Overall quality, I like it. Seems to be a good quality Limbsaver quiver. Never got around to mounting it since it would not hold my arrows. Would probably would fine for toothpick arrows ;)"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Sharp is an understatement! Didn't realize I cut my self taking them out of the box. Shoot great fly just like my field points.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I got it for emergencies and camping.  I'm very satisfied as it appears to have a decent weight and should be quite versatile.  I was sent the red which is more of a brick color.  No complaints on this one.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"not sure what Ringside is thinking. The cut of the bag is lopsided and bladders don't hold air. Replacement bladders are of no help as they leak. leak leak leak without even beating on them. Total inferior product with no quality control in production let alone the person putting it in the box to ship.
Medium Title bags are a bit heavier but action is great and longevity is good. I'm going to get a small Title as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have been addicted to using these during my glute workouts at the gym and have seen a big difference so I decided to order my own set. I plan to bring them with me when I travel. They are excellent quality, very durable. The resistance for each color is as specified and they come with a guide to teach you how to use them. If you hop onto Pinterest there is a large variety of resistance band workouts there as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These were going to my sons fianc&eacute; in Florida were sadly stolen in the mailing process .. I cant afford to replace them.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Love this company and there products. I a corrective exercise specialist and personal trainer. this company has it all.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"Not too great. I thought since it was speedo it might be perfect. Used to come off during the swim as well. Tried it only in the pool.
Would definitely go for the Premium Silicone Swim Cap or the spandex swim cap any day before this one.
I would only use this if I lost all my other swim caps."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I have been wearing this for the past month.  I have never used any of the other similar products, but I honestly don't see a huge advantages over the motion sensors built in to my iPhone 6.  I feel it is most useful for monitoring sleep since it shows when you had the most deep sleep.  This comes with a wrist band and also loop that cleverly uses a strong magnet to clip on belt loops or even PJs for night time monitoring.  I like the loop attachment since I hardly notice I'm wearing it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I really like this product; too bad it doesn't seem to be made anymore.  Will buy whenever I see it at a decent price.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Absolutely love this knife. Its heavy duty. The blade holds a ridiculous edge and the handle grip is outstanding. The assisted open is just gravy.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have several stashes (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency rations and several 'bug-out' bags as I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hits the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasions to replenish my office stash as I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points:
1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect as the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bars themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper has been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bars are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bars TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is bases on 1,200 calories per day (3 meals a day for 3 days at 2 bars per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calories per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bars are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, does not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergencies and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: as I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catches the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this as an addition to another board I have. The board is entirely made of some sort of plastic while also providing a fishnet pattern for traction against your feet. Very sturdy with some stiff flex (the board has a curve) that makes it very nice to ride. For those wondering why they should buy this, one word, WATER. I live in Florida where it rains often so using my normal bamboo board is pretty much not a good idea. If it rains I'll just take this bad boy and worry not about any puddles. Also it's a great gift, so buy with confidence."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Took a while to get used to the mouthpiece, but I now really like not having to open a lid to get to the water, and don't need to worry about a nozzle flipping open.  I was also worried that the design might be hard to clean, but I'm not having any problems keeping it clean."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Good for touring or cruising bike, and maybe for a long day on a mountain bike.  Too bulky for a road bike."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I had used wood bats in the past for BP when we were still able to use aluminum in our amateur league so it would train my hand eye coordination for finding the sweet spot when hitting. Those bats were ash and didn't have the durability. Our league turned to wood bat so I researched bats which would fulfill my stringent requirements and found Marucci. These bats are hard and tough and make that distinct ""crack"" upon impact with the ball. I own a 32 and a 33 and both bats are solid. I would definitely recommend."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought two. They have looked great on both my vehicles for several months. Now, I just wish people knew what it was around here.

Update: After almost a year more, they still are holding on and looking great! Go Tigers!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"good deal for the money, haven't put a ton of rounds down range yet"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,I ordered this size by mistake but kept them just incase I get a scope they can go on
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These are great polarized sunglasses for just the right price. Easily comparable to other top brands. Extremely light and well built. Very nice for fishing and all outdoor activities. They also come with a very nice hard case to keep them from getting broken. I can see these lasting for a good while.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I replaced the caps on my Camelback Podium bottles (they're real bacteria gardens) with these.  They haven't leaked a drop.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This light is smaller than I expected, but am truly impressed with how incredibly bright and convenient it is.  This is a must have for any outdoor enthusiast, and Go-Bag.  I am ordering another one!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Good pocket size , not too heavy . Happy I bought it , would reccomend to any one looking for an every day carry knife,but some think its too pretty to carry"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"Poor design, handgun fits holster ok but holster mount offers no support on your belt, should have sent back."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Surprisingly strong feels like it's going to last quite awhile, probably will never need another one unless I loose this one. I work armed Security so I need to have a hand cuff key on me in case I need to arrest someone. I usually carry 4 keys on me but this one is the most convenient and easiest to get too when I need it. If you're a Cop, Security, Corrections, etc I would recommend you buy one of these."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Perfect for everything!!!! Only thing that could make it better is if it were a sling backpack....
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Cool product! Good quality, easily opens when you press it and no hitch if you close it again. Good fot gym not ideal for cycling since opening is a bit large. But for cycling you can choose from contigod wide range of products! This set ia worth your $$ im getting another set to give to friends! Vibrant colors as well!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"A lot of play in the winder arm! The one I bought on Amazon, the arm popped out of the watch! I do not believe the hype around this Mako line. Spend a little more and get a Seiko 007."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have both the front and rear (red) light. They are very bright, even in daylight. The lights are compact and the narrow shape lessens the clutter on the front or rear of a bike. My rides are usually less than an hour, and I recharge every other time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I'm  very  satisfied with  the  ArcEnCiel Water Resistant  bicycle  bag. I'm so  satisfied  I ordered a  second  one.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,My Daughter-in-Law loves to take my granddaughter for walks in the state park close to our home.  Unfortunately she had a flat tire on her first time out.  We ordered the tire liners for the baby carriage tires even though they are designed for a bike. The tire size was the same as a bike tire.  The first tire the liner was very easily installed.  The second tire was much more difficult to get into place.  Over all we are very pleased.  No more flats.  They really do work.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This pouch makes a nice way to conceal carry your pocket pistol. It also is the perfect size to carry my HTC Thunderbolt smartphone with an extended life battery pack. In fact, that's what I initially put in it. I was able to publicly remove and reinsert my smartphone several times when I first got the pouch, thus establishing that it was a phone carrier and eliminating questions from friends. I don't use it all the time, there are many alternates for concealed carry, but it's a nice alternative."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,Only two side of mine are hemmed and I hand washed it before using as per some of the reviews because the dye does need to be rinsed. Outside of that it works for me and has held up so far.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Been using these for a little while now for squats. I lack the flexibility in my shoulders to get my hands close together on the bar without putting weight on my wrists. While I work on the flexibility issue, I used these. They offer great support for my wrists even at higher weights, and I can get through my sets without pain. There were a few times prior to this that the pain was so great I simply couldn't complete my sets without taking a really wide grip (which negatively effects performance and safety). These are a good length, and a good cross between stiff and flexible."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"some what stringy.  Very pricey for the quaity.  Not recommended by me, I think I can find better out there."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have purchased other cheaper versions from China, US and UK with plastic clasp and always found they are not real paracord, but plastic imitation paracord.  Having finally paid a decent price I now have a great quality item, and considering you buy this to one day possibly protect your life in an emergency, it seems stupid to scrimp on quality... This is a high quality product at the right price, so happy I bought more for my friends!!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Nice bottle however only if u don't turn it upside down. Leaks a lil when held that way!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"These pants are great, but not for cold weather below 40. Also they are very slippery so when you take a corner on you're bike you slide around a lot."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Handcuffs are great, keep them cleaned and oiled and they last very well.  Next time I think I will go with ASP though."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"This is a great concept, however the holes do not fit 7-strand paracord.  It is frustrating when it arrives and you realize that you have to drill out the holes to fit."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"ok ever since this whole walking dead phenomenon started my hubby has been on this survival gear kick for ""just in case"". I usually laugh at it, but it got me thinking, I have been in situations living around the world where I was stuck in the worlds worse typhoons and was without for a long time. It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared. So when I came across these emergency thermal blankets, I thought perfect, it will go great in my emergency kits for the cars and the house. It comes in a pack of 10, which is so nice, because I have them in my emergency kit in the cars and the house. Each blanket comes individually wrapped in it's own ziploc type bag for easy storage. The bag is about 4 3/4"" x 3"" in size. Fully opened, the blanket measure approximately 81 1/4"" long x 51 1/2"" wide. These blankets are said to reserve/reflect about 90% of your body heat. They are also waterproof and weather proof. Hopefully I will never have to use them in an emergency, but it puts my mind at ease knowing I have them and that they work really well!!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I'm offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways. I completely recommend everyone have these."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"We purchased this for our 2003 Club Car.  Our cart has the standard size roof, flip down rear seat and 6 inch lift kit with huge tires.  This cover fit very will with room to spare from front to back and covers the tires and wheels.  Couldn't be happier."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great for the price.  Not for cold weather though.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent product.  Everything as advertised.  With kayak carrying wheels and a truck bed extender I can handle it alone.  Easily transported in small bed pickup.  Grand kids, 4 and 7, love it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Batteries last longer than I expected, but I ended up connecting up directly to a transformer....no more batteries needed.  Not a bad training device for the beginner, but when you want your game to improve then look at Robo Pong as your next step..."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Excellent spare bike lamp when mtb biking in the woods.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This thing is so much fun! We use this every year for our bonfire and everyone has a blast. I think is adults have more fun with this than the kids do. A must for any beach event.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've tried a lot of outer-eye fit goggles and after a few months, these are the best. Great water-tight fit without cranking the straps too tight, so they're comfortable for a whole workout. I retreat with anti-fog every couple weeks, and they've stay perfectly clear."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I realize other people gave this item great reviews, but I believe they are incorrect. First of all it is NOT a pillow-top, NOT soft at all. The material they used on the seat is like a thick rubber tube, NOT like the picture shows. The picture looks like it would be a nice soft fabric, this is NOT the case. As far as comfort goes, my stock seat is better than this one (specialized comfort seat). Maybe the other reviewers weighed less than I do. I weigh 200 lbs and found this seat to be very hard, stiff and it became very hot in just 15 minutes of riding. it did not protect the sensitive area of my body (men know this area) and it began to hurt very quickly. I would NOT recommend this seat to anyone who weighs more than 175lbs. I returned this seat and purchased a Cloud 9 instead, which is far superior seat. I hope this review helps someone that is really looking for a comfort seat."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Gets the job done protect the tank well. I droped my thank on concrete and this case saved it from a sure crack so that too mee is a product that does what itwas designed to do. Be advised the thank will not fit in a vest with the cover on and anything bogger than a 77cc will not be entirely protected. Love it looks great and would be perfect if you attach tank to gun directly and would also be a must to protect an expensive tank.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Works great for my buggout/ boat bag.. It is durrable and with a few molle attachements it serves me well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great beach chairs!  Easy to carry. Sit low to the ground.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Very pleased. it came well packaged in a nice box with graphics. This seat way exceeded my expectations, which were high. It looks more like a big piece of jewelry than a bike seat! Now I am just worried about it getting scratched! This is a case of getting much more than what you paid for, I can't recommend this higher! Pretty, pretty!! You don't always get what you pay for, sometimes you get more! 2 Big thumbs up!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Look to be well made.  My grandson thinks they're OK....which is high praise.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is a beautiful mat. Item as described and fast shipping. I put this matt to the test and it passed with a 100%. I practice hot yoga a few times a week and I sweat alot. I didn't need my yoga mat towel. The top layer has a grip that increases with moisture which is perfect for me. No sliding, no towel bunching up."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Worked great on our first campout - there was light rain, and the bottom of our tent stayed dry.  Seems durable, the campsite had rocks everywhere and the groundsheet didn't rip or tear."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Disappointed in the reviews about how good the sheath is. Cheap and if you turn the sheath upside down with the knife in it and give it a medium shake the knife will fall out. Flat on the side with out the ZT logo and cheaply made. I don't think the anchor rivet on the sheath knife retention strap will last long before it tears through. Another snap would have been a better idea. I rate the sheath about 3 stars and $25. The knife is very simple, sturdy, nice and plain with a very good grip. I rate the knife 5 stars for sturdy basic no nonsense dependable functionality."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Awesome Kayak and great color.  have fished in bays and offshore towards rigs.  Handled all conditions great, did notice some water in hull when taken offshore however did not affect performance, and would not hesitate to go offshore in it again.  Kayaked out next to guys in hobies, and watched most of them flip while I cruised passed them in crashing waves."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I was at Walmart earlier and saw this item, My daughters Mongoose BMX is only 1 year old but the brakes does not seem to work no matter how I adjusted it. I took the original pads and it was very soft ! After installing this Bell pads on her bike, The braking was very consistent and it makes the tire lock up unlike the original one. The only difference between the two is that the Bell pads are squared and the original was angled for a full contact on the rim but it was too soft for it to work the way it was designed. Cheap replacement and it does a better job than the original one that came with the Mongoose."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Made for the Beretta recoil shooting vest, not for other use. One or two pads fit the vest fine and they definitely absorbs most of the recoil from a high-caliber rifle, but  I doubled up my pads to be sure. I often shoot at the range 100 rounds or so, and the Beretta Vest with two of these pads saves me pain and probably joint damage. Fully satisfied."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,first time I used it It fell apart.. requesting to get my money back or a replacement.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Excellent in every way. Great service from the manufacturer. Good videos online to make custom adjustments.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Great Cooler. Cheaper than other high end coolers, with what I consider better features. Extraordinarily robust construction, with secure yet easy to operate latches, and well through through double carrying handle options make this the nicest cooler I've ever owned. We recently took it on a 7 day road trip.  It did need to be topped off with fresh ice twice, but we were ALWAYS opening it and it was during late May (warm outside).  Easy to drain (built with bottom at a very slight slope to drain---- and the train itself can be connected to a garden hose for remote draining. (well thought through product).

This 45 qt size is the largest size I could get that would still fit in the trunk of my Toyota Camry, but it's easier to keep in the back seat.  It's also just light enough for my wife and I to easily carry when fully loaded. Anything else would be too large and heavy for us."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I have not/will not buy this product. It's is sooooo unsafe. Think about it, if you carry with a round in the chamber ( you're an idiot if you dont) and you stick a gun down your pants, what is covering your trigger? Nothing. No one plans on having negligent discharges but they happen. Number 1 cause--- clothing gets in the way when drawing/ holstering the gun. What if you get in a fist fight and have to roll around on the ground? It wouldn't be hard for your shirt to get wrapped up in your trigger and go off. Do yourself a favor and possibly save your life, get a real holster. Priority 1 holsters makes an excellent product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Arrived with no edge whatsoever. Not a bad knife after being professionally sharpened.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are adorable! So cute and the colors are fun. Takes 3 AA batteries pet lantern. Turn on by lifting the top half, shut off by closing. Light weight, easy to carry. These would make adorable party lights on a string. Kids would live the almost a real thing look and appreciate that the lights DO NOT attract mosquitoes. My only complaint is that the company sent me an email asking for a review before they even arrived, and that is just wrong. Who needs more junk mail?"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The rack is strong and well made.  I had read some other reviews that expressed concern about the quality of the welding joints, but that was not the case in the front or rear racks that I purchased for my Surly Disc Long Haul trucker. Surly may have tightened up their quality control after receiving complaints about the welding.  The package includes LOTS of mounting hardware that allows you to use several options to mount the rack.  About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability. I had purchased an alloy rack of a similar design and do not see much difference in weight.  I plan to take some extended trips with my Surly LHT and was not convinced that alloy racks would hold up on rough tow path trails."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great value for money. Does the job for those cold winter commutes. I would definately reccomend this product

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,It didn't match with my 5.11 bag but quality was great. Bug enough to hold my Samsung S8 note with case.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,A great time saver when separating stainless media from wet tumbled brass.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Great way to keep your hands warm while hunting, instead of bulky gloves."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"STYLE:
Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.  It doesn't have any nylon patches or extra zippered pockets like many others.  The design is clearly more function than fashion, but the overall cut of the jacket is relatively slim.

FIT:
I bought this to wear as a second layer under my overcoat and to wear around the office when it gets cold, instead of a cardigan.  I am a shirt size 15.5 32/33 and the medium is a good fit, though it would probably be too tight over a heavy sweatshirt or sweater.

QUALITY:
Quality is perfect.  No issues with any zippers or seams.

OVERALL:
For the price, this is an excellent product.  I wear it every day and am giving it five stars.  However, if you are looking for something that will make a fashion statement, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"As with most Maxpedition Gear, the quality on the Travel Tray is very good. The size is just right for the things one usually leaves laying about and then can't find right away during travel. Plus it unsnaps to pack well. About those snaps: I have zero problem with them. I don't know if Maxpedition heard all the complaints and made a change or I just got lucky. The snaps hold and feel very secure, but I didn't struggle to get them closed. And no, I don't have some crazy hulk hands."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"...that's not to say they will shoot well in any .22 cal air gun.  Each gun shoots each pellet differently.  There are actually several other pellet brands, shapes & weights that shoot equally as well in the Beeman, but they are considerably more expensive.  So, as cool as the pricier, more 'exotic' pellets are, for me, it's not about cool, it's about accuracy and bang for the buck...and these provide both."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"It works fine and have not had any problems.  We use it every day and it meets my needs, I recommend it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,Not really impressed with this at this point.  I have tried 4 times to get the analyzer to connect to the app without success.  To be fair we have done this right before practice so we did not spend a lot of time on it.  I will work on it at home where we have more time to spend trying to set it up and I will update this post if I can get it to work.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is a good light hammock.

It is contained in its own pocket so you have no pouch to lose.

It is light and comes with fairly strong rope to attach it to a tree or whatever you can find. If you use it much I would suggest investing in tree friendly straps so you don't damage the trees that you use.

It is very easy to put up and it can be done solo with no problem. It is advisable that you look up how to tie specific knots especially for hammocks. You don't want to hit the ground while you are relaxing in the hammock because your knot wasn't done correctly. I've done that and its not fun.

This is a good hammock.

I received a free sample for the purpose of reviewing and evaluating in an honest and unbiased manner."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Just bought some of these from Walmart for $1.98....$8 seems a little ridiculous.

I haven't used them yet...trying to make an adapter to match the threaded part (my hydration pack is not Outdoor Products).
Other than that they seem well designed and worth 2-5 dollars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very long and heavy rope and you can definitely feel the effect of carrying out any of the exercises in the following day or so. There are quite a few varied exercises to try and they are easy to learn. It seems that the focus is on the upper body so I'm not sure you'll end up looking like the people pictured on the box. Still, it's a fairly intense workout and certainly makes a welcome change to using the machines at the gym.

My only criticism is that you need a considerable amount of space to really use the rope effectively.

I normally take a size large t-shirt, but I knew this would be too tight in large and I was right.  This provides some compression for me, but it not too tight and will be perfect for my intended use.  I am 5'8"" tall and weight just under 200 pounds.  I would buy this again."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This is a very good Set of resistance band for home workout or to add intensity on your gym workout by using the bands as variable weight and tension for your exercise. Quality is good and it comes with nice attachments if you want to use it at home. Overall for the price it is a good bargain and a must to have for home fitness.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"This would work fine for pistol casings but for rifle rounds ( which is why I bought it ) it does nothing to resize the neck. I bought a .223 die set to reload. I let a friend come over to use my press because I am trying to get him into reloading while I ran errands. When I came back he got the casing stuck in the decapping die. This had never happened to me so I checked youtube for some advice. This did not go well and the rod was damaged getting the casing out. I logged on to Amazon searched for .223 decapping die. This POS was the only one found. I didn't read the details that this was a one size fits all piece of trash ( we all know one size fits all rarely works ) Since .223 was in the description it pulled it up and I the unknowing unexpecting consumer ended up buying a $16 paper weight. This is my first and only bad experiance with Lee or Amazon. Buyer beware the ""DEVIL"" is in the details."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,A bit tight to close.  But the rubber will probably wear down a bit to make it easier.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This has worked well for me.  It does exactly what it's advertised to do and seems well-constructed.  I've had mine for well over a year now and it's still going strong.  Used exclusively for taking hot soups to the office for lunch - I've never used it for coffee but expect that it would perform just as well for that purpose.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I got this horn after I nearly got hit by 2 cars (who weren't looking before turning right) within 2 miles. Luckily, I haven't had a repeat of that day yet, but I'm confident that this horn is loud enough to grab any driver's attention.

I'm a little disappointed in the sound of the horn- it sounds like a really loud kid's toy horn. So, even though it's definitely loud enough for cars to hear, I wish it had a little deeper, more ""serious"" sound to it.

I also find it a little difficult to use it with my air pump- the floor pump's tube isn't long enough to reach it while it's mounted on the handlebar so I have to unmount it and unwind some of the horn's tubing to get it low enough."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,I got only one and this one broke at the first use.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Worked great ! Very nice action under water. It worked well for me.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area."

I can not stress enough how much time this prep station saves me. Doing all 4 steps in a second or two means i do 1k round runs instead of 200 round runs in the same time. If i ever grow two more arms i will buy a second one. Would recommend to anyone."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I own the 4x16 and the 4x12 models of this scope. They are clear and sturdy. I have one on an M&P 10 and I can put 10 shots touching at 100 yards.

This one actually seems to work better than the one that came with the band.  Maybe it has stronger magnets or something because I have a high success rate of connecting on the first try whereas the original almost always requires some ""finagling"" to get it to connect.  The long cord is a huge convenience too.  I have it plugged into a USB wall wart which easily reaches my desk top when I'm ready to charge the band.  Couldn't be more pleased with the product."

Usually I buy a 20-30mmhg but on the advice of my cardiologist, I ordered this pair of X-LG.When the product arrived the box, like the picture was marked XL (which I have been buying for 4 years now based on my doctor's prescription). This pair of TRUFORM like the others I have bought in the past did not have a SIZE tag in them. However, I attempted to try them on and they are so SMALL  that I could not get them over my foot!.Obviously TRUFORM incorrectly packaged a SMALL in an XL package. So I will not buy TRUFORM again!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"We are over 70 years old and these lifts make kayaking possible. Without these, there is no way to get the kayaks on top of the car anymore. They work totally as advertised. You have to have the Malone J-racks to use them but it's worth the extra purchase."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,We LOVE this stove!! This took things to the next level. It is very easy to use and cooks pretty evenly.  This made camping so much more comfortable.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"Its a great little vest! But when you Order MAKE SURE you check that the site has selected the correct size. I had clicked on XS, however XL arrived. So i had to return it. I tried to RE-ORDER the same vest, and realized that each time I clicked on XS, once I looked at the checkout, it said M, or XL again. So strange. So unfortunately, I never re-ordered it. I would have if it had selected the correct size in the check-out."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Spoon is LARGE, Fork just sturdy enough, knife will cut if don't expect it to cut anything tough; really like way they lock together.  Very light weight which is both advantage and disadvantage -- great for not adding much carry weight. not so good for sturdy factor or comfort of use."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Best car camping sleeping bag ever. especially on those colder camping nights. Not as hard as some are saying about stuffing it back into the bag. Just shove it in starting at one end and rotate as you go.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great knife. I wish the handle was just a bit longer. It's a Ka_Bar so no questions on the quality
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great knife for the money!  Has held up well to moderate use so far.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Most reviews only had bad things to say about the on/off button.  Seems OK for me...  Overall a solid light!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Does what it says on the tin. Mine was 50'x1"", not 1""x50' as expected. Through the transformative power of geometry across the line y=x I was able to re-orient it to fit my desired application.

Don't forget to get some buckles of joiner plates to attach them with."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Very nice quality shirt and fit right, feel good and warm jacket, enjoy the jacket every time when ride the bike."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"These are not the greatest deadlifting socks. They're a little on the thin side for deadlifts. The huge benefit is that i do look like Flash Gordon, even though me shins are dripping with blood. It is better to look good than to feel good."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I liked the case,but the green color was not as bright as online. It was more of a lighter green and I wanted a brighter green. Just a matter of preference. Also,it was smaller than I thought. It didn't look as if it could hold much,not that you should pack as if going on  vacation,but I'm just saying! So,with that,I returned it. Other than that,it was a nice small bag."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Leaf 0 bag. This bag compresses well and easily fits into my hiking pack's sleeping bag compartment with room to spare for my clothes for a weekend backpacking trip. I camped with a lean-to tarp configuration instead of a tent. The temperature dropped to about 35 overnight. I got sweaty in the bag because I sealed myself in it completely (head and face) which caused moisture to build up in and around the bag and allowed me to get cold. However, I'm confident it would keep me warm in the same conditions if I kept my nose and mouth outside of the bag when sleeping.

Overall, this bag looks great, feels comfortable, packs away small, doesn't weigh much, and is warm.

I would recommend to a friend as a backpacking bag."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,No more 'sand spur' flats since I installed these on mine and my wife's MTB's.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This water bottle is great for little kids who are active.  We got the Contigo Trekker bottle which holds 14 oz, but noticed that my son was running out of water by just a bit.  I only wish they made this size for kids, in the stainless steel fashion, since it keeps the drink cooler, longer.  But overall it's a great product!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I absolutely love the collar! The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars was it does loosen like other reviews stated. I use a harness however, when walking my dog, so it's just an accessory anyway."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Like the product, purchased two and fits my S&W M&P 40 full size and 9MM shield.  Nothing special about it.  Four stars is a good rating for me."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"First impression: This is a tiny mesh bag, I bet they sent me the wrong size.

Then, once unfolded: This is a huge towel! Way bigger than a standard shower towel. Its about the size of a big beach towel. A BIG beach towel.
Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

Finally: overall, it is a very absorbent, very soft, very well-made towel. Absolutely perfect for a gym bag because it packs down to the size of a water bottle."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This latch powerlifting belt is 10mm thick. It's huge and very supportive for those heavy squats or dead lifts. I do recommend this if you are pushing some high weight. The latch buckle is pretty easy to adjust. You do need a screwdriver to set the amount of pressure you want. I'm a 32 to 33 waist but I have it on the lowest tightest openings. I may need to drill a hole or two otherwise great products I do recommend for powerlifting. I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"All 3 of my grandkids love these.  They said it makes a big difference in seeing under water, the way they fit and feel and recommend that these are the ones that I buy in the future."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Solid holster. Fits my Sig SP2022 9mm perfectly. Only gripe is that the holster comes a little bit loose from the paddle/belt loop attachment sometimes, but it only takes a second to tighten up again. Everything else is great though!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Good for a few times, but takes a lot of pumping, it ultimately failed after doing a lower unit, and 4 differentials."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"It takes a while to get this shirt on because it is tight and will twist up in the arms as you pull it on. But once you get it sorted out, it feels great. Compresses without digging in or being constrictive."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a survivalist and outdoorsman and love to fish so this fishing vest is right up my alley. I cannot begin to tell you how much room for storage and equipment this gives you. It is amazingly adjustable and is more than comfortable for me(6'3"" 270 lbs) with room to expand, yet if I were 5'10"" and 170 lbs it would be just as comfortable because it literally is made for anyone of any size. That's the kind of stuff I love. Let me give you an idea of how much this can fit. I am able to take along with me in this vest a survival kit including emergency blanket, water purification tablets, two compasses, 50 feet of paracord, mid sized walkie talkie, fire starting materials, set of keys, wallet and spare hooks, line, sinkers and lures.

It doesn't weigh you down, you have multiple pockets, Velcro straps and areas to clip onto. This material is rip stop and tear proof, and incredibly breathable! Comfortable as can be and it looks great. I have seen some vests that look deplorable, this one is incredibly fashionable as is it practical. What I love most is that I don't have to carry an additional bag or rucksack when fishing any longer as this is more than capable of carrying everything I need. With a dry bag in tow I have everything covered. I was provided this item discounted in exchange for a thorough review. The seller asked for honesty even if it was non favorable. That shows integrity and you can be sure you are buying from a reputable and honest seller.

I can't see any outdoorsman not loving this vest. I'm pretty picky when it comes to outdoor equipment and I love it. I trust that you will as well and at this price for what you're getting you can grab a couple of them..."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Bought these for my husband. His CamelBak tube got gunky or something and I thought this would be an easy way to give him a couple replacement tubes and cleaning equipment. He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This is the second pair of Addidas warm up pants I have ordered. Fit is comfortably loose around thighs and legs. Nice for working out in. Washes and dries easily.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Holds the morrell elite super duper good & is very sturdy.  The super duper bag does rest on the bottom bar of the stand just a bit though.  Went together easy & going on 3 months of heavy use with no issues so far!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"great craftsmanship. Perhaps a little more sturdy, the connection between the blade and handle."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,For the price I'm very pleased with these rings. They look good and are very comfortable. I feel like they could be a little more durable but for the price I would recommend these to anyone.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,They arrived as scheduled and are exactly what I expected. Very nice and I can't wait for icy weather to try them out.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have taken on two trips and is the perfect size for all your needs kindle, phone etc.
It also doubles as a small range bag and I am sure I will find even more uses for this bag.

Quality is very good"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Perfect for camping & overnight music festivals. Feels soft and absorbs well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"This food packet will do the trick,  but packaging could be a tighter seal,  guess we will see the longevity of the food."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I bought with the intention of purting it on my AR15......But i never did. Its well built but just put it on.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I had to move my scope mount so it would position correctly but it has caught every spent brass cartridge and no jams. Easy zipper to open and dump the brass out. Perfect.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This thing is great. Keeps ice cold ALLLLL DAY, even while drinking from it. They have a different cap design so you can drink out of it like a mug. No condensation rings on the furniture or the desk (to destroy your papers, books or magazines) either. Don't put carbonated beverages in it though, because you'll end up with a mess all over the place when you open it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Like the kick stand but there is nothing that really fits a mountain bike frame. I drill a hole in my frame and got longer screws from ACE hardware.
Still not great, May see if I can weld it on my Gravity Mountain Bike, some how. Bike shops don't even want to deal with it, because of the need to drill the frame on one spot, Too bad they don't make any with larger brackets, for Mountain bike frames! I could not find any body."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Good product for the money, received in a timely manner"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Almost as good as sex. These are simple & easy to go from one cal. to another just by changing the drum. like these. Price seems reasonable also.
Good buy."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These are great storage for ammo and almost anything you want to secure and keep water tight. Very satisfied with my purchase.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Dr Skin is quality made. Used this for snow sports and cant complain.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I layered this flooring over top my carpet flooring in the basement for my squat rack, weight tree, and other equipment. Works really well and stays snapped together despite the carpet."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,Line is strong & does the job but it has a lot of memory. Nothing special but its as good as most cheaper mono line that i have used.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"great product for fishing. super for night fishing. I recommend if you buy these , get more than you think you need because they do not hold tight when trying to set the hook. ( lost 2 already ) they fly off when trying to set hook. better to take off before setting hook. I ordered 20 pieces and only 17 arrived unbroken."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"This worked pretty well for me, but it is overpriced. I paid $17, and it should be more like $10-$12. At $17, not a great value."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've used these tees for several years now, in fact this is my second purchase of these in about two years. They last a long time and do the job."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This thing is the coolest!! It's perfect for my little hands, doesn't have a complicated lock to close, and exactly what I was looking for. I've been wanting a small versatile knife. It exceeded my expectations,  and it will be used daily.

I received a discount in return for my honest review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,It works fine and is really cheap so I can't complain
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"After I put the motor mount kit on this, and a Minn kota 30lb trolling motor, this thing moves! Fits 3 but two fishing comfortably. I insist on spending around 50$ extra and putting a wood carpeted floor in this, I made mine one piece and it fit on my car roof perfectly.(09 impala) how thick is it? Its pretty damn tough! I was happy with thickness but I would still use caution around sharp objects. Otherwise excellent comfy and convenient, I mount mine to my car roof partially inflated, works great at 45mph. But I only travel short distances with it like that. And yes invest another 10-15 for a quikfill electric pump if you don't have an compressor, unless hand Inflating for 30mins is your daily workout !"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Love it. Been looking for a fitting camo hat and this is perfect. Fit was about there; maybe a hair small but very very close.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These saved my fingers for sure. Very easy to use and was able to load quickly. Came in very handy when I loaded my four new magazines which were tight.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I received this pack today, 2 days after ordering it.  Sold and shipped from Amazon, and I paid  $75.79 for the silt gray in small/medium.  I was planning on writing this review after using this pack.  But I'm so impressed by its design that I want to shout it out!  :)  I plan to use the Raptor 10 for long road bike rides in the Colorado Rockies.  I usually stuff my bike jersey pockets with snacks, chap stick, cell phone, small wallet, warm gloves, warm synthetic hat, reading glasses in eye glass case (so I can see what I'm doing to change flats!), inhaler, and I tie a long sleeve bike jacket around my waist!  Wow!!  I'm looking forward to using the Raptor 10 on my next ride!  I'll update my review soon.

Update:  July 24, 2012
So far, I've used this pack on two long road bike rides, where I spent a good amount of time climbing out of the saddle.  It is still a 5 star item to me.  Love the design of the water system!  The pack felt comfortable against my back w/o any noticeable water sloshing.  Everything came out of my back jersey pockets and into my Osprey.  Sweet!!!!  More back comfort!  On my first bike ride, I found the straps were so easy to use that I made ALL of my strap adjustments while riding!!  What a well designed pack.  It's too small for day hikes though, but perfect size for bike rides!!!  Planning to get another Osprey pack that's big enough for my day hikes."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This baby is great when paired with an indoor bike trainer and Vivoactive!
I can bike in the comfort of my own home and log miles on my Garmin connect account.
So far its been great. No issues with connectivity to my Vivoactive!

I would recommend and would buy again!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've been looking for leather lifting straps and saw these. While I can't offer a comparison to other types of straps, these are terrific for those days you want to go heavy on deadz but your grip won't let you."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"It's a pretty simple product. Holds your feet together, does its job."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have put a good portion of time and thought into reviewing this product. Overall, I have determined it deserves 5 stars. I have taken several photos which show the condition when it arrived.

Pros:
Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, many easy to access pouches, comes with carrying case, price, size (fits in trunk yet still large enough to enjoy)

Cons:
Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much

I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you. The amount of places to store things tends to be a bit much for the display aspect. Overall, this is a solid chair."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is a must-have for families going to the beach! I've hauled s a lot of beach stuff including 6 tall beach chairs, beach bags, umbrella, and coolers in one load!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have been carrying this knife for over a year, no signs of wear and as sharp as ever. A few strokes on a ceramic stick, and it's like new. Very impressive to see and use. The best carry knife I've ever had. (and I've had an used a lot of knives)"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"great for senkos, holds the bait firm and sure snags some lips."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Bought these to replace the trebles on all my Rapalas when the box was left in a wet garage. They seem sharp and look decent, well see how they hold up!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"looks good, but flimsy. if left on the bike carrier the wind catches it like a sail.
also. came off while riding. don't know when. this one is gone."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Well, it's a strap. seems to be well made. Not much to say except that it is exactly as advertised."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,As beautiful as it is functional. Looking forward to putting this thing through its paces this summer up here in Alaska.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"was very upset , what you see is not what you get."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Wonderful suit.  Arrived on time, and I love it!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,Broke 2nd use. Don't waste your money. Cap wouldn't close and water leaked every where in my trunk.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Almost bought a Yeti but then found out that Pelican made a US cooler. Super solid almost tactical build. But the coolest part about it which I discovered later is that standard steam table pans fit perfectly in the cooler. I use a 1/3 X 6'' deep pan to keep meat and cheese out of the ice. The lip of the pan rests in a groove near the top of the cooler and keeps the pan above the ice. It slides easily side to side to access below it without removing the pan. Very slick. 1/2 pans would work well too. The pans come in 2'' 4'' & 6'' depths. I have the 35qt. But the pans should work in the 45 & 65qt. since they all seem to have the same dimension from front to rear. See my user photo. Note the weight of this cooler. It is not a trivia item. I'm glad I got the '' small one''. It is bigger than it looks in the photos.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Eliminates utilizing calipers and other ""ammo sizers/checkers"" during/after resizing/reloading processes."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"It's not well constructed.  I haven't used it to field dress a deer yet, but out of the package the knife seems sharp, but the blade wiggles greatly.  The blade wiggles so much that I'm afraid the lock may break and there goes my fingers.  I can't suggest this item.  There are better dressing knifes for just $5 more."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"They are very well made, comfortable, and warm. One of the best fitting pair of socks I've ever owned. They also do a great job of wicking the moisture away from your skin. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great quality sock."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are really good cycling gloves. I have had them for most of a year now, so have worn them many times. They still look in great condition. The material on the palms makes for comfortable riding.  The velcro fastener is quick to do up and undo. The two tabs on the fingers of each glove are a revelation!  They make taking the gloves off SO easy. So much better than dealing with inside-out gloves every time. All in all well designed and manufactured gloves."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are a perfect compliment to the S&W M&P. The stock sights on the M&P are very good but these made picking up the sight picture so much easier. The installation was easy and only took 15 minutes. The dots are bight and easy to pick up. The price was great, these are Trijicons. If you have an M&P you cannot go wrong getting these."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,This is my go to holster for appendix carry. Perfect.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Topeak makes the best bike accessories and in this case, they have upheld their quality and workmanship.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,The air pump is use less. You can barely get 20psi in a tire. And it doesn't fit in the bag. The bag is difficult to strap under the seat. The multi-tool is the only good thing about the kit. Wasted my money.

I ended up cutting a link with a saw and then prying it apart. Easy install I recommend buy a chain breaker for the extra 13 bucks just in case you have to sized wrong. Would buy it again!!! Also recommending to Friends with motor vehicles as well!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rotary-9322-Roller-Chain-C-35-3/dp/B0092GSNHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rotary 9322 Roller Chain C-35 3'</a>"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"The description says it will get you to 120 PSI. In my experience, it's nearly impossible to get the pressure in over 70 psi with this pump. Good enough for triage, but not ideal.

Based on other positive reviews, it seems that three things are possible:

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.
2. Poor quality control (some people get great ones, a few get lemons)
3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

At $25 it's not a super value, so I am less inclined to cut a break. I'm not going to toss it, but I wouldn't buy again either."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Quality rack, and installed in minutes.  Delivery was faster then expected, so overall a great product with quick customer service."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Good simple watch for the price. Not a smart smart watch or a suunto but a good very day beater.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"For anyone who rides a bike, this is necessary!  Some days I ride for over 3-4 hours and these Padded Shorts helps.  Without these shorts, I would not want to ride more than an hour.  I ride a mountain bike with a specially made seat for men...but these shorts are still needed.  I had these for over 4 years now and still going strong.  I highly recommend."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Only used it once over the last 5 months, but it didn't disappoint. It was actually in a race, so instead of losing 10 minutes on a flat, after 3 minutes I was on the saddle again."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not.  I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing.  These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore).  I *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I love these when wearing them to the gym. Great fit.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This sight was really impressive for the money. At ~20$ you could have a high-contrast bead. The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too. I put it on a micro-compact 9 and it is not too big. the multiple thread sizes were great and I just opened the original hole  slightly for threading and had a 20$ high-contrast fiber post."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The muffs work as described very nicely.  Volume controls are easy to operate and have good ranges.  I wish the decibel reduction was higher, but I knew the level when I purchased the muffs.  Still is a very good product for outdoor firing range use.  I personally would not use them for ear protection in an indoor range.  Being hard of hearing, I intend to use them for hunting.  They should be a big help in a tree stand."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I have mixed emotions about this water filter system. I love how it is hung from a tree, and doesn't require pumping, but I did run into problems. I used it for a week in Boundary Waters, at least the bag. After 4 days,providing water for 6 people, the filter was completely clogged, and is incapable of being back flushed. The pre-filter screen was not fine enough to catch the ""material/ suspected tannin"" in the BWCA water. I eventually attached a Sawyer inline filter to the outlet hose which got me through the last 4 days. My Base Camp Pro did come with the new and improved filer, but it couldn't handle what I needed it to. I love the idea, but was pretty disappointed."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Just what I wanted big enough for one small pistol, holster and compact cleaning kit I like I like."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Daughter loves this. It is very soft and provides good sleeping support.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Alright, the shipping is dumb... I'm sure everyone is used to that now.  But, this thing WORKS.  I don't live in a jungle, but I figured an 8 dollar machete would work on all the thorny vines that infest the campsite I use.  It did that and more.  I cut down saplings as well.  The edge isn't razor sharp, but I could probably help that along.  For 8 dollars though, well beyond what I expected.  Only problem I had was learning where the blade needed to strike my intended thorny prey when rooted in the ground.  Other than that just swing around, works just fine.  Sheath is decent as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"Even though I bought the extra-large, it's way too tight. The pocket over the bust would appear very lumpy and awkward under clothes. The weave is very tight and it would be warm to wear."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is an attractive water bottle with a sleek design. It has a handle on the lid, and indents for the fingers for a more secure grip. The inside is stainless steel. The built-in straw is plastic. I'm not personally a fan of water bottles with a plastic straw because they need to be regularly cleaned with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/special-brush/dp/B000QD5GAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">special brush</a>, and I prefer drinking out of the top of the water bottle itself rather than laboriously sipping water through a straw.

I am not grading down this water bottle for the straw, however, since other people may prefer a straw and see it as ""a feature, not a bug,"" as the saying goes.

Reviewer disclosure: I received one of these water bottles from the manufacturer so that I could test it out in order to write a product review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"Primary pictures show items with no branding. I specifically bought this for that reason! I don't need to see the name of the company that makes my fork while I'm eating spaghetti!

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

Otherwise, they are light-weight, and they functions as one might expect."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Surprisingly decent sleeping bag with a reasonable amount of room inside. Very compact when compressed, and light weight. Needs to be lofted each time before use (not hard to do). Loft is around 1-1/2"" with sewn through baffles. Probably good for upper 30's, low 40's Farenheit as a comfort temperature for most sleepers - I have not had a chance to test it at temps this low yet. Zippers are small and can catch the light outer fabric easily so use caution when zipping in. Stitching was good - no loose threads. No hood, but I knew that when purchasing. Good value at less than $100."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,Sight tool was well made but needed some padding to not allow the direct contact with pistol slide.  It allowed the slide go get scuffed.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"wouldnt keep hands warm in 32 degree weather, and no wind."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,A little bulky . Great protection. Slips a little after long training.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've been interested in learning how to ride a Penny Board for a while now. I didn't want to spend $120 on one without knowing if I'd like it or not so I decided to buy this 22"" skateboard. One of my friends has a Penny Board and when you compare it to this, you can tell that this is amazing quality for such a lower price. The only difference is that a Penny Board is a little smoother and will most likely last longer. This would be a terrific option for those who would want to save a little money.

Tip: When you first get the board you find that you may need to loosen the wheels, so you can do that easily with a tool that it comes with."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Love this, guns are still on after driving cross country."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Good solid mount, gave me the height I was looking for without being too bulky"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"As Zebco's go, these are top of the line.  They cast really nice and are easy to use for non-fishermen (which is why I keep buying them for guests to use).  In freshwater they hold up well and continue to cast well, but in saltwater they turn into a pile of rust and the coating on the handle and middle section peels off.  They do seem to still be working despite that though."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I tried a few of these to keep around as extras if I lose my good one or is I have people training with me that didn't bring gear. Pretty thin and flimsy, also quite small. OK enough for a temp or for weightlifting but not something I would want to spar hard with at all."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"My daughter has been in dance she was 2 and had been using hand-me-down leos from her cousins. They had this same material, but I wasn't able to find it anywhere. We have long-haired cats and Siberian Huskies, so any little tiny pieces of lint or animal fur that was anywhere in a 60 yard radius ended up on her cottom leos. I went to dance specialty stores to try and find one like this but they either didn't carry them or were sold out. Nothing sticks to this and it's very comfortable for her with a nice stretch."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Even without the cleats my feet haven't sliped off the pedals and they haven't spun around and hit me in the back of the heel. As soon as this years championship international drunken downhill big wheel races are complete and this springs tricycle century race is over I'll put them on my Mt bike and give them another review.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've recently upgraded my marker to the Q Loader, after doing something searching around I found out that the NXe harness is the best to hold extra Q Pods so I went ahead and bought this. The pockets on this harness is really well made, my Q Pods can slide in and out with no problem yet when they are inside it's a really good fit so even when I wear this upside down for quicker release they still won't fall out while running in the woods. I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future. The velcro on the front is of very good quality, the contact surface area is big enough and I never have to worry about it falling off. I do, however, wish it was regular camo instead of digital, would match my shirt better but that's a minor hitch, wasn't described fully on the page but not really a big deal to me. Overall this is an excellent product, like I said before I got this mainly for my Q Pods and they are a great fit with this so I'm extremely happy with that, and if anyone who's in the same boat as me looking for a harness for your Q Pods, this is it!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This Howard Leight Patriotic safety glasses kit is a nice set to show your patriotism at the shooting range. The glasses are well made and comfortable. The earplugs are a plus, but I don't know anyone will see the patriotic earplugs in my ear. Most importantly, they reduce the noise to a bearable level."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I'm sorry I couldn't keep these collapsible water bottles. I loved the color, the feel, and the sturdiness. I have a vapur bottle that doesn't stand proplerly- with or without water. It also leaks so I can't keep it in my bag. With the Nomader bottles, I could have them anywhere. I love that they stood when empty. I only returned them because they didn't fold as small as I would have liked. I love that the company was so good about emailing before and after delivery. They were really on top of customer service. They emailed care instructions and encouraged communication. I had purchased this in green and blue. I may repurchase if I find a smaller one. Lovely product. I wish it rolled up smaller. Hope this was helpful."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Really saves your back by not having to bend over. Plus, if you hit like I do (which isn't to good), the balls are scattered all over the place. Made it much easier to collect them and start hitting again."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"From the female of the family: This beautiful top is a lot more than a ""T-shirt."" It is simple, yet elegant. It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

I've only come across the Royal Robbins brand recently and I think the quality and style of their lines are excellent.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"The holster is really well made, it looks great, and I picked it up for a sweet price (goes up and down if you watch it), but I don't really use it. The belt loop is really big, I wear a 5.11 belt which is 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in thick and there is still a ton of room for the loop to tilt in either direction. Kind of a bummer, but I can use it as back up when I can't pocket carry my J-frame."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,The hotshot is a light orth waiting for. All my previous lights did not come close in term of brightness or handiness. Just ensure you had charge the light before usage. Another good thing is that hotshot can be charge with a portable power supply and use at the same time.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I searched all the blogs but NO ONE could tell me how to hang this type of derailleur on a cheap bike...

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

< http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048UFRME/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 > .

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good....

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I consider the Competition Electronics ProChrono to be the industry standard for general purpose ballistic speed measurements.  There are other, fancier, and more costly options - but this chrono will get the job done accurately and reliably time after time for a reasonable price.

The unit stores several strings of fire, each holding a large possible number of shots.  When reviewing the string, each shot can be reviewed, in addition to specified ""Lo"", ""Hi"", and ""Avg"".

A reliable chronograph is essential if you are a reloader.  Bullet velocity is one of the most crucial metrics to use when perfecting your recipe for perfection!  Also, if you compete in shooting sports, such as IDPA, you will need to know that your ammunition meets the minimum requirements.

Competition Electronics is one of the most trusted names in the shooting sports, making other standard tools such as shot timers (if you've ever been to a shooting match, you have probably seen them in use).  I trust the brand because their equipment works!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This swimming suit set is absolutely adorable!! I love the look of this, it is perfect for any little girl, the colors go beautifully together! The suit itself is a pale champagne pink color, the skirt part of this is made of shaggy white tulle. The swan is embroidered on to the suit, the beak of the swan is made if shiny sequences and adds such a cute look to the suit. This is made out of nice quality materials, it doesn't hold water and is thin and comfortable for my daughter to wear. As far as sizing goes, this runs pretty on track, i ordered this in a size 6t for my 3 year old who typically wears size 5t/6t and it fits her pretty nicely, she is about 43lbs and 42inches! The straps on this are simple and crisscross in the back, they are also resizable. This is a unique and fun suit, definitely cuter then any suit I've purchased in stores. The little hat that came with this is made out of the same materials as the suit, it is kind of small for my daugh though. Overall I'm really happy with this!!!! I recieved this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,It worked great waterfowl hunting this past weekend in heavy wind and rain.  Everything stayed dry.  The large compartment is easy to get access too with small interior pocket for storage of smaller items.  The exterior mesh pocket holds calls and extra shells for quick access.  Like the durability of the bag and simplistic nature of the bag.  I get tired of the overly organized bags on the market that zippers break and you cant find anything.  This bag will last for years to come.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I do! The right size, the right features, excellent quality. The knife itself is solid and is not threatening in a tactical knife sense. People are fascinated by this whenever I produce it from my pocket for use. The unique appaerance of the blade is really quite cool, and also as you know (I hope) quite a functional plus. It is light enough and has a profile slim enough to sit in the pocket unobtrusively. I like the fact that you can open it via a flipper motion or by the thumb stud. I also found the same knife with a black handle and with the Damascus steel blade because I like this one so much."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Nice replacement beach balls. Needed these for a last minute trip.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The questions I had about this product before I received it were: is it actually waterproof or just water resistant? Is it durable? Would the material crack? Well, it really is waterproof. It uses two very heavy-duty Ziploc type strips to seal the pouch and a very strong Velcro type strip to hold the flap down so the Ziploc type strips are not allowed to open. The material is soft, flexible, durable, and not likely to crack. So, if you must bring stuff with you and you don't want them getting wet, this is a good choice.
I received a complimentary sample for a fair review."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I've always wanted a rowing machine to add to my basement gym so bought this one.  It was easy to assemble (not a lot to assemble, just a couple pieces).  It has differenct settings and found I needed to use it a few times to find the right tension to start with.  Must admit it kicked my butt at the higher tension so had to back it down a bit.  The only problem that I encountered was the left chainguard was broken during shipping.  I contacted the company as instructed by the enclosed manual and was told they would get a replacement part out to me. (The book states they have 180 days to respond so I'll have to wait and see but I did receive good customer service). Would recommend it to the 'at home gym' person who wants to add something different to their workout equipment.  Great buy (just waiting on the replacement part)."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Prob the best cooler in its price range for weekend camping. Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler. That was one of the final selling points to me as coolers loose so much temp through the lids. Nice balance of capacity and portability also, and a drain plug. Wait and you'll see'em down in the low $20s sometime on Amazon and snag some. You'll use them. I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day. It might just make 4 days if really loaded with ice and opened infrequently, but I'd say 3 is more realistic.
After the 3rd day of a camping trip, 80sDay/60snight, 30lbs of ice(3 bags), 3 12 packs (from walk in cooler), 12 pack water (cool basement temp prob high 60s) I still had slushy water to pour out. Cooler was probably opened at least 40 times.

The problem was with the bib shorts - the openings for the legs were so small making the shorts so tight to pull on that I fear the seams would rip within a couple rides. The shoulder strap material also isn't as robust as other similarly priced kits that I own. Mostly returning due to the size mismatch between the jersey and bib shorts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,The top on the is hard to open and close. Sometimes I have to really shut it down hard to get it to work right.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"This is an excellent fly rod for the price, it is well built and casts very well for the shorter distances it is designed for. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light weight, small stream rod.

Update 6/7/2017, I was putting on a new reel that is balanced to this weight rod and the but cap came unglued. I have reglued the butcap and I hope this works. I would suggest a change in the but end and the reel seat, make it a one piece ynit and not jusr a ring under the cork handle and another ring with threads on the but end that is just glued to the rod blank."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Purchased two of these for a recent overnight backpacking trip.  Worked really well to compress my ""car"" camping Coleman mummy sleeping back down to a more manageable size and strap to my pack.  Used the second bag to compress the clothes I brought along to save space.  Seem fairly well built and did not fray at all when I pulled the straps tight.  Zippered pocket on the top is useless."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"DUDE. I think this is such a great steal for a knife like this. It came sharp, holds a nice edge, I love that it came with a lanyard, and the design is pretty freakin' sweet, as well. No regrets, I am happy I bought this as I am a collector of blades. It's a must have."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Been using this belt for multiple shooting classes with a holster and around town. I have had no issues with it. Great belt and works even better with there striker pants that are also excellent, but pricey."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"My son is an MMA athlete, and over the years we have discussed, and purchased, equipment. I know he has a similar pair, so I decided to see how these match up.

They fit my hands pretty well--they felt good, not too tight or loose. The padding is really thick. They can be put on and taken off easily. All the stitching seems very strong.

I asked him for his opinion and he likes the way they feel, as well. He does not have large hands, though bigger than mine.

Now I am seriously considering taking up MMA so I can challenge him to a bout !"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Had to rate this because my daughter thinks those fingerless  spiderman gloves are the coolest thing on the planet.  I don't think she has even tried on the pads, but she's all over those little gloves.  I would buy this again just for those silly gloves.

I have had some other parents tell my that their kids liked fingerless gloves.  I remember liking fingerless glove when i was a kid, actually I have a nice pair as an adult, they are just cool, so get some."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I have used this stuff for years and it works great. Caught 22 bluegill on 1 dry fly last Friday and fly stayed dry! This is good stuff.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Excellent goggles. No leaks. No fogging. Very comfortable. Easy to adjust for comfort.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Nice and light weight. Too small for my child with glasses tho.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great low price for a nice bandolier. The shells fit very tight when installed in the sleeves. I don't feel like they'll fall out when I'm in the woods or at the range. I'm able to store different gauge buckshots and slugs on the same bandolier.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"A must have for any Glock owner considering replacing their own sights. Works as it should. All metal and has adequate grip surface. I'd give it 5 stars since it does what it should, but it is fairly crude machining and the TRUGLO on mine is barely visible (but that's OK) Just an example of sorta crude construction. For $10 bucks you probably shouldn't expect a nice finish."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Ordered a 4"", 6"" & 8"" x 3/8"" target plates. shipping was prompt. They were cut cleanly, the edges were square and free of slag. Have been wanting to go with steel plinkers to reduce costs of paper splatters, also being to be able to hear the hit and not have to always walk down to my stand to review shots. The plates have exceeded my expectations and will additionally reduce shooting costs. Would definitely recommend to my friends. Don't plan on the need to order additional plates (unless I want different size/ shape)!."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great product perfect for the money.  Does what it is supposed to do.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I really like this call.  The hen calls are a good low tone, and the gobble call (watch a video) gets reply calls from turkeys almost every time.  For an inexpensive box call, I couldn't be happier."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,This is a VERY LARGE umbrella. The colors are bright and because of the way it is vented the wind does not easily get up under it. The button to open it works easily and it closes as expected. It would be too expensive for my budget but is clearly and excellent umbrella.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.
but yes, they are good.
but beware after a couple of heated practices the stink on these gloves is seriously offensive... SERIOUSLY. I wash mine every two practices... although the new ones, seem to have worked on that, the material lasts 3 sessions between washing."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...

Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!

-ONE LAST THING... Be sure to clean your gun before you fire it! -Mine had white styrofoam particles all over it and indside the barrel from the packaging. Just a friendly ""FYI""."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Perfect basketball net for the price. I put it down to 7' and dunk on it from time to time and it holds up fine. Even through the hot summer and cold winters.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Cheap. Sits in the bug out bag. Helpful if you live in a region with lots of water like me. Reduces the need for on hand preps.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,i have purchased 15 of the new adidas green star balls for the kids I coach.  The kids are high school varsity and they love them.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great product because it worked! Great product because it worked! Great product because it worked!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,Beautiful pants and I gave it a four-star rating because it is pretty thin and just a tiny bit see-through.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,High quality umbrella with the greatest UNCONQUERED team on it. I bought this right before the Noles' most recent BCS Championship winning season so I'm tempted to get another one again.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Honestly, these are the best things for organization and packing light.  I love them!!  I have shown them to everyone I know that travels.  They are especially good if you are on the move because you can get out only what you need for the night and pack quickly the next day."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Very impressed. I purchased one refurbished by Geek Squad, so I expected something that seemed like a refurbished model. It was absolutely flawless when I received it. I like the screen size, and the simple black band. It contrasts nicely with, and compliments, the sliver finish of the clasp and the body of the watch. It is a very aesthetically pleasing device, and has a comfortable wieght. The display is bright and crisp. I just received it yesterday, though, so I really haven't had time to explore all of the functionality."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"Love the M9, but cheap plastic and broke off easily for the use of 1 hour. Still have the magazine for the remembrance of my M9."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've never owned a Buff, so I can't compare the quality, but I sure do love these little guys. They are easy to throw in a backpack and they come in very handy for hiking. I've used mine as a scarf, balaclava, headband, and hat. They go in the washer and dryer just fine. I don't see a reason to pay for a brand name when these seem to do the exact same thing at a fraction of the price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"To be fair, I need to say my daughter does really enjoy this, however, I am very unhappy.  We have owned it for just over 1 year and the net as well as the padding is COMPLETELY falling apart!!!  I contacted the company and they told me I can buy a replacement but there is only a 90 day warranty.  We payed close to $200 for this little trampoline and feel like it should last longer than a year.  I personally can't recommend it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Great brush. Helps to make my SB base resume its best condition after waxing
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Holding up great!  After two years of hard use it is still going strong.  Have carried upwards of 75 pounds on it with no concerns.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"built may rivet builds, decided to try a screw build. I won't do another. Rivets are easy enough, don't see a benefit to a screwbuild."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,Fits well and met my expectations.  Three stars because I believe these rings are priced at least three times higher than they should be.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Works as it should and reasonably priced. Props to the seller.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is an exact OEM replacement for my 24V/80lb iPilot Riptide ST, and presumably other similar models.  This is a great unit and meets my every expectation.

Linking is snap.  Hit the learn button on the head of the iPilot and hit any button on the remote.  You will get a confirmation beep.  That's it.

This stays on as long as your iPilot is on.  As the remote battery ages, the remote will go to sleep on you.  This is normal. I have never experienced any other disconnection or difficulty with linking with the original remote or this replacement.  When the remote goes to sleep, the trolling motor keeps doing whatever it was doing.

If you are having trouble linking remote or are losing connection (other than the sleep mode to save battery on the remote), it is more likely that your iPilot unit is going bad.  Keep that in mind before you throw this product under the bus.  These remotes are solid as a rock.

I recommend having at least two methods to control your trolling motor.  This remote plus the foot pedal, or two of these remotes, or one of these remote and one mini remote, etc.  Also, having a couple extra batteries on board is a good idea.  The batteries last me about 10-12 months with moderate use, and replacements can store unused for 3 years or more.  You do get some warning that the battery is dying, but not super accurate.

This does not include the fancy Minn Kota lanyard.  The product description does not say that it is included.  Minn Kota website does not say it is included.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this product brings the lanyard.  To be clear, this product does not bring the lanyard.  It is the remote unit with the battery installed.  That's it.  Do not take away stars from an otherwise stellar product because you wanted more that was supposed to come with the product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Somehow missed the detailed picture of the pellet. Arrived in good shape. Pellets are in a round metal can which is nice for storage. The pellets are hollow point with a point protruding in the center. I was expacting a solid, pointed nose. Not sure of the  ballistic performance but suspect at normal distances it's a don't care."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"These glasses are fantastic! I read some of the reviews and was a little nervous about buying them, but I can honestly say they work great in the Florida sun! I am able to comfortably drive into the rising sun on my way to work, while everyone else has their visors down."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"3rd time I've edited this review.  Beginner golfer, in process of learning.  Initially I was very impressed, but realized some marginal flaws.  The club, like many drivers and fw woods, is a bit too long for average height and wingspan.  The shaft is very flexible - dunno how it compares to ladies or senior, but you can see it flex as it moves.  If you buy it, make sure you close the clubface at impact and not just address.  If your hands finish too far forward and leave it open, you're gonna get a monster slice.  But if you hit it straight, you'll get good distance for the $."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,The product arrived as described in a timely manner. I have not had the opportunity to use this and hope I never will since it is for emergency situations. This is a great addition to my personal emergency kit I keep in the car and I added one to my scout`s 10 essentials kit.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I was a bit skeptical at first because I have never used this type of equipment before but this is fun! I highly recommend. %100 money back guarantee

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Really nice ammo can and boxes. Very good way to keep reloads handy, organized and protected. Will be buying more of these!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Love it. At 340 lbs got in it and jumped around it did real good
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I used this to install a new crank set. This is big enough to allow me to get some torque on it to secure the external bearing BB. I didn't experience any slippage when torquing it down, but I can say if a person is not careful it could slip."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I travel a lot for music festivals all over the United States and a few beyond. Sometimes this means flying even though it's not my favorite way to travel and sometimes I still need a tent when I get where I'm going. I'm not mad of crazy cash and also really believe that caring for the things I own and continuing to use the same possessions is the best form of conservation so getting this footprint was a no brainer to protect my new Kelty Grand Mesa 2. I've had a chance to pack out with it twice and it's way smaller than having to bring a tarp. It easily fits in the Grand Mesa's bag along with the tent, does a great job protecting the bottom of the tent from wear and the two nights we had substantial rain even though I was camped on a slope my tent stayed very dry. I get that it's a little more expensive and less versatile then a tarp but for me it's exactly what I need in a super light weight easy to pack product and I'm very happy with it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Wow. It does need a good amount of conditioning to get the leather supple and smacking right. It is a hard hitting crop. The fiberglass has no bend, so you can hit with just the flapper sometimes, then give a much more painful one with the tip of the bat also striking. Make em scream."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I commute to work and this is the best light I have ever owned.  The high beam seems more than enough for me to ride a paved forest preserve trail in the pitch black.  I had to lower the power when I hit the neighborhood streets. On driver stopped to talk to me saying I was blinding him with my light.  I now keep the beam pointed lower.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Great Boat Plug ! Wish they sold the plug only, as a spare .I leave my boat in a storage yard so I take it out."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The reviews I read on this were mixed. Some loved it. Some hated that the bottles leaked? I wanted this exact product, but was very nervous about finding out if I was going to hate it or not lol. I decided that I was already going to be sweating up a storm going for a run, so what was a little leaky water on top of that? LOL Turns out, my bottles don't leak at all. I couldn't be happier with this belt. It has a nice elastic band that is adjustable so you can get a perfect fit. So refreshing since I previously owned a camelbak from HELL that would not adjust down small enough to fit me once I lost weight. ANYWAYS, If you have the misfortune of getting leaky bottles, I would recommend contacting the seller. I really don't think its a matter of a bad product as much as the occasional faulty one. I'm totally happy and would absolutely recommend this to friends."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I bike in about 20 degree cold every morning during the winter and I have cold air induced asthma so a good balaclava is important to me. This one is excellent, it's warm, its breathable without letting too much cold in and the fit is snug without being too tight. The drawbacks are its a little short length on the neck so you need a high collar to tuck it into and the portion that covers your nose squishes it badly. A little longer on the neck and just a bit more fabric across the nose and this would get five stars. Overall, Underarmor continues to satisfy my extreme endurance needs with superior product technology."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"These ear protectors are performing much better than expected compared to many of the reviews I have read.  The sound dampening is very good and the unit is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I expected the radio to be a poor performer based on other reviews, but found it to be decent for a shop environment.  A stand alone radio that I have been using has much poorer reception than this unit.  The nice thing is that you can actually hear the radio easily when operating large equipment (the shop radio was drowned out).  What really surprised me was the speed which Amazon delivered the product.  It arrived the day after shipping confirmation; that's great."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,A must-have for extreme cold weather.  Just don't last as long as advertised or as long as others I've used.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,This is the second pair of these exact goggles that I have ordered this week that came with the mirrored coating very badly damaged. I returned the first pair that came and now I will be returning these. I am very disappointed.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I hate getting sweat in my eyes while running and biking, so I am always looking for a good solution. I had the Halo headband for two years and it worked okay in mild weather (70s), but in the middle of summer (high 80s and 90s) it would soak through quickly and let sweat in my eyes and down my nose. I finally got sick of it and found this. I like the idea, it looks stupid on me, but if it keeps the sweat out, great! It does, but the little hair tie looking things that come with it to size it are too different. The smallest one is tiny while the next size up is nearly four times the circumference. If I put the smaller one one it squeezes my head and make my forehead look purple, if I use the next size up it constantly slips down my head and lets sweat through (although less than a saturated Halo did). I am going to look around to see if I can find other options the little circular connectors. I love the concept of it and if I could get a good fit, I think it would be perfect."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I hoped that the problem of undersized recoil pads was solved since most of the reviews are a few years old. Turns out, it is sized perfectly for how it is designed. This Pachmayr recoil pad is only 4.600 inches tall, and the original pad on my new 1895 is about 4.730 inches tall. The Pachmayr pad is sized so that you can cut about 1/2 inch off the stock and install the new butt pad with no change to the length of pull. I'm not willing to cut up my stock just yet, so I'll be exchanging this for a grind-to-fit Limbsaver."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These are terrific gloves. My go-to glove and far superior to what I'm used to...Pear Izumi. The padding is different but works well for my hand. The pull loops for taking the gloves off is very durable. And of course the price...very affordable.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I have used this watch for a little less than a year now and find it loses about five seconds every couple of weeks.  Since I run on a ""by the second"" schedule, it is important for me to know the correct time to the second.  However, I am adaptable and will set my watch about five seconds ahead and over the course of the week I know it will catch up.  It is easy to set the time and only takes a moment to reset.  I drive at night and the light is still working on the watch.  I had an atomic watch which kept perfect time but the light kept eating up the battery and was worthless driving at night.

Easy to read numerals, good light, lightweight, and had it kept better time I would have given it five stars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,The stitching around the thumb is in a really weird spot and it makes them incredibly uncomfortable. Thin and comfortable enough but I had to return them
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string. If you don't, you are lucky to get them in and out of the water a few times."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,AWESOME PRODUCT! DESERVES WAY MORE THAN 5 STARS! I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ATSKO SILICONE WATER GUARD SPRAY FOR MANY YEARS ON ALL MY SHOES/SNEAKERS/BOOTS/CLOTHING ETC ETC AND THIS SPRAY HANDS DOWN IS THE GREATEST!!!! A++++++
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This quick dry towel was absolutely perfect for a 12 day backcountry camping trip through Montana.  Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry."

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.

But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"There are some things I like about this product and some I do not.  As with most tools models, brands, quality, what the tool is being used, cost and other things make a buying decision.

This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.

Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.  But then I prefer top of the line tools, they usually pay you back in useability, durability and quality of work.  But then this drill may be ok for you.  I really cannot say I had problems with the battery kicking out, but then that is me.

I put this tool somewhere in the middle for quality and cost.  Time will tell on the durability.  So I give it 3 stars."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations. Such is modern life."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"My primary use for this toolbox is to keep inside of my truck.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother. I can look in my box and see exactly what i need and where it is. No more moving stuff around to get at the tool that I need.

I plan on looking into more of excel's products."

The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I, too, have been a DeWalt user for many years, having moved to their brand when I felt the Makita line went substandard.  After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

As I mentioned earlier, I looked at all of the kits available.  For the price and the product you receive, I don't think you could find a better value for your money than this kit."

I have not used it much, but for an occasional, weekend warrior fix it guy, this seems to be great.  I love it's compactness, lightness, and power.  It came charged and I still have not had to re-charge.  these need batteries hold a charge for a long long time.  I would recommend unless you are an everyday professional...then go with a professional, very expensive drill."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Okay, initially sent in a five-star rating, but this is why I hate to commit to a review early on; I've had this light installed for just a few months and it has failed.  Constant on/off of the light once is gets to dusk; had to shut it off altogether.  I wish I had looked at the negative reviews first because I wouldn't have bought this.  I'm not planning on getting any satisfaction from the company because apparently, they don't honor warranties, but I will try.  It's too bad; it seemed to be just what I wanted."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"This is an ok tool to have. When I first received it the safety pin on the handle spinner came off and got lost in the mail, I replaced the pin with a new one and made some adjustments to spinner to keep it in place, now it work ok."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Great revues but no one mentioned the fact that it does not come with any needed accessories!  No hose (which costs about $22 at local store) and nothing for it to hang from or connect it to the shower pipe (which costs about $11 at store).  What?!  So, this no frills shower head ends up costing over $60 (nearly $70) when all is said and done.  No thanks...sending it back.  I'll  go get an all in one Delta or whatever."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,BEST LIGHTING OFT HIS TYPE EVER. VERY BRIGHT BUT EASILY ADJUSTED. GREAT MOVEMENT AND STABLE FOOTPRINT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WOULD BUY AGAIN IF NEEDED. SUPER PRICE. Hope replacement parts are not outrageously expensive and readily available.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,We bought this to get the hard top off our jeep and to store it when not in use. It has worked great.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This is my 1st inline filter. My TDS reading was 156 ppm before I installed the Woder 10K-Gen 3. After a few weeks of use the reading is 65 ppm. That's better than some spring water.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Quiet, works very well.  Easy to install, especially if you are replacing an Insinkerator."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Light when I need it, or when an unexpected visitor comes, but I didn't turn on the light by the door."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Very nice desktop DVM with a really nice bright display.  Probes are superb.  Well-packaged and well-made but quite heavy, presumably due to large power transformer inside.  Printed literature is minimal;  the actual operating manual is provided in PDF form on a CD.  There is hardly any information provided on how to use the unit for more advanced purposes like integrating it into a LabVIEW system; you'll have to dig elsewhere for that.

The only negative I have on this is that my unit was shipped with a 110VAC power cord as expected but the unit itself was set to 220VAC.  Kind of funny that the certificate of calibration traces back to a Fluke product!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I love this product by Chamberlain, BUT!! please be aware if you purchase this product used and the person who previously owned it did not properly close there account THIS WILL NOT WORK! and you will be out the cost. Chamberlain cannot override their password so unless you know the person and can have them release the product for you to use, Do not buy it used. This happened to me and I can say that the Chamberlain representative was very pleasant and very helpful. They explained it to me and said all they could do was send me a new one, which they did. THANK YOU CHAMBERLAIN!! I highly recommend this product and the company!
I hope this helps some of you avoid this problem..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is an exceptional detailed fixture. Looks expensive. the only time consuming thing is putting on all the crystal pieces.
A touch of old world charm."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"IMO Kester is my gold standard in solder.  Heats and flows easily, consistently and predictablly.  Other solders will do the job, but Kester is my favorite for consistency and ease of use."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Product comes with different attachments.
I was able to attach this directly to my shop vac hose loosely."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Shank on one lock bent during first use!  Otherwise, the locks seemed to work fine.  Easy to program your own combination code and locks feel strong and heavy-duty.  But the shank should not have bent so easily.  In fact, the lock was completely open when we picked up the suitcase from baggage claim at the airport.  There was no other damage to our luggage.  A strong, safe lock should not be able to be bent so easily."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,the only thing better then the starter kit is getting this package and adding on to them!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Gotta use with the Quick Pitch systems which is great.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Broghter than expected.. very nice will use it at work and home perfect size for your pocket..
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Well not much to them really, I did check them with a micrometer, right on the money!
That said you can't beat the price!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Would  buy again.  A little weak but work fine.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This product isn't particularly pretty, but it's cheaper than the under-sink type filter and, presumably, provides clean water in these days when we can't take for granted the safety of anything we eat or drink. I haven't tested the water, so I'm basing my assumption of effective filtering on faith. The filter is large, and the way it fits means it's harder to fit a large pot underneath, so take your faucet height/sink depth into account when considering this. It doesn't leak, and we've had no problems so far."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These bulbs give out just the right amount of lumens for my usage - on top of a book case where I place the Crucifix and other religious items - not too bright, not too dim. I highly recommend."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Nice unit for the money. Easy to use on all the batteries it checks.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,These worked great to hide chipped up paint around door knob.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,These work amazing under my recliner.  I placed 2 at the front and 2 at the back under the recliner and so far so good.  I haven't had to reposition the recliner because it is hitting the wall.  My recliner sits on carpet.  Problem solved!  Happy customer!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"At first, I thought it would be difficult or distracting looking through a screen mesh. But after the initial novelty wears off (maybe 2-3 minutes), I almost forgot I was wearing them.

I had to contact the seller as one of the screens was very discolored and was distracting when someone else was looking at me to talk (it had no effect on me looking out). They were AWESOME and sent out a replacement pair that day!  And THAT is what Customer Service looks like!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This shower head is fantastic.  My other shower head was very noisy, and the water flow / coverage was not that great.  The main problem was that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water was warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortable temperature.  This new head allows us to visually see when the water is cold, warm, and hot, it allows us to set a temp that we like visually (color of blue, green, red depict 3 temp ranges), has versatile spray selections although we basically use just the rain shower setting.  Also, a giant plus is how fast the shower warms up to temperature now - I'm guessing this benefit is because of better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.  Anyway, this is a perfect addition, is not a gimmick, and the product is attractive and appears to be well built.  We have had it for 4 days, but so far so good!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I love these things, I hope they never go cheap on these like so many other items do. Always a clean cut, available in many sizes, clean up well and hang in there.  You want a  machine grade cut in aluminum, steel, plastic, .....wood... start here..... with the Champion cutters."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Very easy to apply and dries quickly enough for second application. Don't know why people complain about this dripping, just have a paper towel in your free hand while you brush on the sealent. Very simple and there is plenty of solution for multiple jobs. You only need one bottle for a standard bathroom space."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I was pleasantly surprised with these coveralls. I was hoping the would not be super thin material and easy to zip. I was not let down! I love how everything is connect, these are not 3 separate pieces. Just ONE piece, so easy to just slide the booties over your shoes, then pull up the coveralls, zip to desired area, and hoodie over head. I use this during a deep purge of a house with lots of dust, dander and allergens."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Bought this for my mother as a replacement for an older lamp she had.  She loves it.  She says it was easy to set up and to use.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Small, but put out good light! Hung in the alley beside restaurant, and light up the dark space well for the passing customers. Do not get a lot of direct sunlight but still work well."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,F***** makita is dissapointing me. I want one of these so badly but i cannot get one that works as it should. I bought one through home depot and had to return it because it was burning my plywood edges nasty and struggling to cut. Also the track was warped. Then i bought one through amazon and it never arrived. Got my money back and purchased it again. But again the track is not straight and now this saw makes a very weird sound as soon as u turn it on. Returned it and waiting for a replacement. Hopefully third  time is a charm with amazon.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Look good fit fine. Color and finish look good. Heavy quality. Sound like a rain storm when the air blows through them, a little loud."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it.
Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it. I only did the bypass for one of three lights just to see if anything changes. Now turned on the lights and I could not notice any difference! No humming noise from the ones with the ballast (not bypassed) either."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"If like me, you hate drilling or hammering various holes in your walls just to put a picture or canvas up then you will love these. You simply attach one to each corner of the picture, remove the stickers on the back and then place on the desired spot on your wall and apply pressure for a few minutes. Be sure to have your wall marked out beforehand to ensure the picture doesnt go on wonky
For something not too heavy like a regular picture, these work like a dream, but the heavier you go, the more strain you will be placing on the stickers and their glue, so these are not suitable for large heavy glass or wooden frames, which will probably end up falling to the ground."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"I thought these would be easier than soldering.  I was wrong.  If you can solder, you should get a better connection and save yourself the money of buying these connectors."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,These work great for replacement bulbs and are significantly cheaper than at local battery and bulbs store.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"What'so not to like?  Well made, variable speed, easy chuck lock and 3 hr battery charge all at a low low price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This kit solved my problem of wireless doorbell range issues where you cannot place those wireless kit doorbell buttons outside on your metal framed front door.  Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.  Since the wireless transmitter is now inside your house, you get much better transmit range and you can place your remote wireless doorbell much further away upstairs and it will still be triggered.  So this is a good useful solution kit to get."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,The construction is good; the functionality is nice; the versatility is neat; the battery life is positively impressive. Overall this is a really good product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Price to performance, this tool is pretty great. Performs extremely well with very light use. But as soon as you start to torque with this, forget it, you're better off using your bare hands.
The handles of the pliers, after about 3 weeks of light use, began to flop around which made this tool useless. The joints where the pliers and the handles join is crucial to the performance of this tool. There is no way to take this tool apart and repair those joints. So if it fails, the tool is garbage."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Very light weight and nice. It is somewhat hard to coil up even after stretching it quite a bit.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These glasses are the answer - the right price and the right, light, comfortable fit."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"The day it arrived I opened it up and the lights went on and off intermittently. If I placed it very carefully on the table, the lights will stay on but as soon as you touch the solar black panel the lights go off. It's defective.

New Update:  The Company Customer Support contacted me and is sending a replacement.  Great Service so far, will be 5 stars once I get the new lights, but I have to say AMIR is very responsive"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,Water stained and hard to keep clean.  Need to wipe after each use. I would return it if I could.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Wasn't too impressed with this, it was broken and I needed to return it. I did not reorder because o just wasn't impressed with the material or it. I figured if it was broken so easily when it supposed to be sturdy and strong there was no sense and re-ordering it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,The wire is very flexible and should work fine.  I marked it down because the red and black wires are completely separate from each other and this was not made clear in the description.  I was expecting a single two conductor wire not two one conductor wires.  The title and description are worded so that it could be taken either way.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Has about every security screw, driver bit you might need. Flimsy box, and the rack does not hold the bits very tight. The longer bits are great for getting into tight spaces. You may not use these often, but these bits are hard to find at a big box store."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"There are few flashlights as versital as this. Streamlight makes this device in many vetsions. I prefer the sportsman model as the tactical ones include an infra red led. If you have nvg's you might prefer the tactical versions.

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman models. The military ones will start at the lowest setting once activated. The sportsman is just the opposite.

The various colored leds serve various rolls. Red keeps up your night vision, great for not disturbing your partner at night when nature cqlls. Green is the color human eyes are mosr sensative to. The blue is a bit of an anigima. Someone with more detailed info should be refrenced here.

This my 'go to' flashlight. I keep one at my bedside and another in the end table next to my easy chair.

It's hard to find anything to complain about this. I reccomend you get one or two. I know they are expensive but if your safety depends on a good flashlight, do you really want a $5 cheap wally world one?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These are perfect for the firing range! Very effective for ear protection. As far as how they fit, I was worried because I have a big head and thought there was a possibility of them being uncomfortable. They fit very snug, but not painful."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"My husband loves these 9 in 1 tools for his work but the tips DO NOT LAST!!  We have three of these now with broken tips, we buy one every year. They are not that expensive, but there should be a way to just replace the tip and not make the cost as much as the whole screwdriver! So far we have found the tips for this thing to be about the same as buying a new one!!! We may find a better one out there some day, but for now this one does the job.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I can't praise these enough; they are sturdy, rigid, well made and do the job really well for screws, electronics or whatever small items you have. I'll be buying more!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased this switch to replace the small molded on-off switch on a 1-1/2 horsepower, 120V air compressor.  That original switch lasted only about 4 months.  The Leviton web site says: ""HP Rating: 2HP-120V 2HP-240V-277V""  so the switch should have no problem with my compressor.  I installed it a few weeks ago, and it's been working fine.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Just perfect . no cracks and worked well. The metal neck though is a little wobbly
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This is a much nicer although more expensive desk lamp than the one sold by Taotronics.  This metal lamp has a nice quality feel to it.  Pay a little more and get this one.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"This stuff is  the worst quality I ever had. I am a sider (construction worker), and it last about two hours , before it get holes..

Don't waste your money!!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,These things are wonderful! Love them and when I ordered this time around it looks like they received a nice upgrade. Cant beat the warranty either. I recommend this to everyone and will continue to use their products.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"works great & great build quality.  However, I would not recommend to use with an electric snow blower.  The cable is just to thick to use in cold weather. It is worth spending the extra $20 & getting the blue cord cold weather cable.  I also plan on using this one on an electric chain saw."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,Be careful when you buy a fuse. sometimes it does not fit for yours.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"I got it because it has a magnetic end. Which is strong and holds on to the piece of metal that you want to hang on the wall. Well built and withstands drops from a couple of feet.

Would i buy it again? yes... but i would buy the same generic china made one that is exactly the same at half the price.

Edit: middle bubble it doesn't really give an accurate reading. Half of the liquid is gone :/ kinda worthless just to use the level vertically only."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Really cute -- kind of like a disco ball, but with multi-colored lights. Surprised at how far the light reaches. And cheap! Great for a kid's party, but I have no idea whatsoever what purpose I had in mind when I bought it for myself.
Tried turning it on and dancing around with the dogs when I've had a few drinks, but they didn't seem to notice."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,this worked out great and came in handy I am thinking of buying another one later.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"They are good quality and I think the price was a good deal. I also like the new hex key adjustment built into the thumbscrew. A couple of things worried me a little. The 10"" strait jaw and long nose pliers have a bit of play, side-to-side, in the jaw and they don't necessarily align perfectly when you close them; there is no play at all when they are closed. I'm not sure this really even matters, but it bothers me. On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever seen long nose locking pliers, old or new, that didn't have a little wobble in the open jaw.
All of the curved jaw pliers are fine, so I'm giving them  a four over the two loose jaws."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Well built piece of necessary equipment if one needs to plumb a door level ductwork etc. I should have bought the 5 point laser.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,I use it to clean my tankless water heater and it's fine. It's important to make sure the free hose is well secured in the bucket or it can spray loose and make a mess.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Good price for a good quality router.  Light weight and controls are easy to use and access.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Good price and good item.  No leaks.  Works great.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Nothing to say but this was everything I needed as well as it being durable. Im completely happy with this
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Love this little guy, works very well. Being educated about the product and have used it now. I would caution folks to really research the accessories. For example, I'm mostly going to be using it for wood carving. There are only a couple wood carving pieces in this entire kit, so a lot of it will most likely not be used. May behoove some folks to purchase the Dremel itself, and then purchase your bits separate, may save you some cash and give you a better selection of things you really need."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These LED nightlights work well and provide enough light at night to navigate safely around the house without blinding you. The sensor is very good at sensing ambient light during the day and switching off. In darker corners, however, if the daylight is insufficient to trigger the sensor the light will stay on. In our case this is welcomed as we have a darker stairwell and the LED light provides enough light both night and day. Recommended and a good value for the price."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

We have only used the pump a few days so these are our comments."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Another reviewer wrote about this and I missed it, so here it is again:  If the power is turned off to this unit, it trips.  The other reviewer points out the best or worst case example:  If you plug aquarium equipment into this, and the power goes out, even for a blink, you must press the reset button to restore power to the equipment.  A lamp would be another bad thing to plug into this, since you would have to find and press the reset button to turn the lamp back on.  An alarm clock would be a bad idea for obvious reasons.

If you can live with this constraint (I could), then the good news is that it seems to work in all other respects."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have used this for fine cracks in my drive way for about 5 years.  Some cracks take multiple fillings to finally fill the crack.  It sticks to the concrete and holds it together keeping it from spreading out.  One of the really important functions is to seal the crack so that water can not get down to undermine the concrete or to fill the crack in the winter, freeze and spread the concrete apart.  It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.  It works wonderfully like nothing I have ever seen before and I have owned homes for 49 years."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"My order for the Gosund T8 LED Emergency Nightlight Flashlight of 3-in-1 Function For Hands-free arrived in the mail quickly and timely thanks to Amazon Prime which is well worth the money if you order regularly from Amazon especially for the added free benefits of Amazon music and Amazon Video in addition to the free 2-Day Prime shipping.

First Impressions-- Looks good out the box.  Feels solid and has good quality construction feel.  Seems like a good high quality product.

Closer Inspection and usage-  Great multi function emergency light.  This thing is awesome and has some many uses.  It uses 3 AAA batteries which are not included.  3 modes of operation -- normal flashlight, flashing side lights and a red strobe light which can be used as a emergency flare.  Not too big and fits great in the hand.  Good device to function as a simple flashlight or an emergency safety device when needed.

PROS:
---Excellent, excellent Price (well worth the money)
---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see
---3 modes
---Hands - free operation
---Can be used as an emergency roadside flare

CONS:
---none

Overall, if you are looking for a good quality, emergency flashlight, road flare, you can't go wrong with this from Gosund."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"The machining is crude; running a fingernail down the edges isn't necessary as one person said; just look at it closely.  However, for any homeowner-type job it's likely to be used for, I think it would be perfectly fine and I have no intention of returning it.  As to the loose handle, a pair of #47 O-rings (AS-568 #009), easily available at any hardware or home improvement store, will give you the ability to remove the handle as needed, or use it in any position along it's length without falling out - a feature I like."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Shop Fox D3030 16-Inch Full Ext Drawer Slide 100-Pound Capacity Side Mount, Pair Review

I bought 2 pair of the Shop Fox slides to use for a custom closet build. They were easy to install and when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blum-Universal-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B002K9TAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blum Universal Mounting Bracket</a>&nbsp;i was easily able to mount them to the base of my 1\2 plywood shelves. The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.

Pro's
 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

Conclusion
For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Great quality light.  I am skeptical of new lights after the government makes us do something but this little guy performed great. Quality of the visible light was nice as it was for reading.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Worked great but failed to heat after a year. Visually identical to one I bought at a ""big box"" store.  One of many cheaply made brands, usually constructed in foreign nations and imported.  This particular one failed like two others we bought because they use a mechanical thermostat that uses inferior materials for the electrical contacts.  After a year or so of constant use, the contacts form pits from the welding-like spark that takes place when the contacts separate.  Eventially the contacts are destroyed and the heater core fails to warm to the proper temperature.  It may never get warm or it may get too hot.

Be forewarned: heater elements which glow red hot can ignite hair and cloth fibers that get sucked into the heater and cause fires.  Shut the fan off and clean it thorough if you smell the oder of burning hair or other burning smells."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough."

My existing confidante drain was routed through my crawl space about 30' gravity drain through a foundation vent draining right up against the foundation. Summer heat made for LOTS of water pooling. The hornets and bugs loved the fresh water! I have a utility sink right next to my a/c coil in the garage. I set this unit up right under the a/c coil drain pan, 3/4"" PVC pipe into pump container and routed the 3/8"" tube into mop sink. Plugged it in, poured water in from a cup to test. It fired right up and continued to work perfect. It's very quite and it comes with the check valve so water in the tube vertical doesn't drain back into the resivoir. Very happy with it!"

Why would I do this? I didn't feel comfortable attaching one at the toilet's inlet tube, which would be more appropriate (different model with different fittings)."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Well made tools.  They are pretty long(  9-3/4"") and not petite, so keep that in mind.  They won't work for *really* small work, but they are pretty versatile."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"used in place of T3 150 watt Halogen bulbs, Huge electric saver,"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This is the second set we purchased for our second bathroom. The Moen products are the best I have found for both quality and looks.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,They flicker and do not dim fully. These are cool white-nowhere near warm white. As expected the cool white stayed the same color when dimmed. The whole reason for dimmable lights is to create a more romantic atmosphere. Think candle light. The light must become redder than warm white. So we replaced the bulb with a tungsten bulb.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This lamp is replacing a smaller 3xAAA type headlamp. I wanted something more powerful and this fits the bill. Will light up an entire room and perfect for doing work in dimly lit places where you need both hands. The only complaint is that you have to cycle through all 4 modes to turn it off. I prefer some other designs where you can turn it on/off back to the same mode depending on how quickly you pressed the button. One thing i may try is putting in an inline on/off switch on the exterior wiring. I've tested pulling out the batteries with it on and reinserting batteries put the light on back on in the same mode so hopefully the mod does what I need it to do.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I. Go get one today!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very preliminary review. I'm a little miffed that I'm even writing it. Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!! I will buy more of these units until all in my home are replaced. 4 so far but have a half dozen or so to go in the next weeks/months assuming I don't find issues. Love the nightlight, btw."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This sprayer does what it should, but it's made from very slick coated plastic so hard to handle with soapy hands.  Plus the hose is molded plastic rather than a metal sheath so doesn't want to lose the kinks inflicted in packaging so far.  But for the money I would recommend it without hesitation."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,We bought 30 of these for the kitchen in our new home.  They are solid and look great on our cabinets. I suggest with all cabinet knobs/handles that you use a little lockttie on the screws so they stay snug.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,Good quality wire but two times I ordered plastic device broke and all the wire was a mess!!!!!!!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Made like garbage. These Cree bulbs are made of glass covered with a thin layer of soft plastic. While bright enough, they will break - shattering the inner glass - at the slightest provocation. I ordered several of these bulbs and half arrived broken or with defects in the plastic layer covering the glass."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"so far 50 holes on one bit through 5 1/4"" LVL's attached to SYP piles, about 12"" of solid wood."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this impact bit set by DeWalt relatively recently, but so far so good. Product quality seems to be very good, they hold up to my use (Carpenter) no problem. The assortment of bits includes everything I use regularly with my impact. Putting the bits away could be easier, the lay flat orientation can make it a bit of a pain ( especially with cold fingers). If my opinion changes down the road I will certainly update this review.

So far I wouldn't hesitate to recomend this product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This was a Christmas present for my son.  On Xmas day he opened it then used it to weld our Xmas present.  It occationally tripped the 15A circuit breaker that we had other appliances running on.  After moving it to a 20A breaker it worked flawlessly for the next 6 hrs while he welded our rebar yard art present.  He really liked its performance.  He mainly used 7018 3/32 rods.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"My favorite out of the 1, 2 and 4 led lights.  These things are great.  Battery life is unexpectedly great.  It has lasted on its first batteries (3D's i believe) for over 5 months of moderate use"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Nice set of bulbs, they aren't too bright but bring a nice ambient light. They are very attractive, interesting. People always ask about them. I have them throughout my kitchen, again if you haven't purchased these before they are dim."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I like my fingers at the original length and position. This helps to keep them that way, and the magnetic feature keeps it handy; stuck right to the side of the saw table, next to the face shield and the hearing protectors."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"The seat is easy to install and aesthetically pleasing. Toddler seat is stable. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seat is very flat. There is no rise or ""horn"" in the front. When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their privates are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chances of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high. My recommendation to the company is to add a contoured toddler seat. This seat is probably best used with an older toddler who understands the concept of being over the hole with no guidance from a contoured seat. We're returning ours."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,These things are very comfortable. They definitely make doing tasks where you crawl around on your knees much easier.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"The old 5000V 30mA outdoor transformer died after 20 years.  The sign though is indoors.  This product worked GREAT as a replacement and the pull chain on/off is a really nice added feature.  This is a 10,000V BTW but will work for older 5000V signs.  We are all lit back up now."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These are beautiful.  We just built a new home and had chosen these lights to go over each vanity in the Master Bath but our designer was not able to get them because they were on backorder until 2 months after our home was scheduled to be completed.  I checked Amazon and was lucky enough to find 2 - which is just what I needed, and for less than the home designer was charging us.  Plus I had them in my hand within 2 days so the electrician was able to install them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I have  only used it one time but it worked great
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Keeps weld splatters off my welding nozzle tip which is what I bought it for.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"So I got these to use as small scrapers, not to open electronics, but regardless they seem to be good quality"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Was hell of tight fit into the sump well, took me 3-4 times to get just right positioning, thereafter it works just fine. So when you install it, make sure it absolutely will NOT catch on anything."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Waste of money.  The batteries only last for max 20 hours (if at all).  What is the point?  Batteries are almost more expensive than the string lights.  I have never ever given a 1-star rating, there is always a first... and appropriately so."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Empire Level 27318 Ruler is just what I wanted. Use it all the time. Good product. Thanks.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,We use these in our Data Center and found these are a great price and you cannot go wrong with Leviton.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I don't know why I didnt' search for this earlier.  I went to my sister's house down south when we encountered this amazing product on her back door leading to the patio.  This product was super easy to install and definitely keeps bugs out without hindering air flow.  Love it and will definitely recommend to anyone who wants great coverage from bugs!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,exactly as described. works well outside for our canopy fan.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"this does not fit on the Jet saw, we had to rig it up with dryer hose to be able to hook it up to the dry vac :((  it's not 4"" it's 3 3/4"" which doesn't fit over the piece on the saw"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,These are sturdy filters unlike some others brands I have purchased with flimsy cardboard frames.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Workings well on low amp machines with extremely good penetration.  Use for thin or light steel components or sheet metal.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,The adjuster works ok but sometimes it's difficult to get it to lock down properly. When it locks properly this is a really easy to use wrench and it's a good physical size making it pretty easy to get into most tight spots (as much as expected with a large wrench).
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Beautiful heavy duty faucet for a fraction of the price of local stores.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Works great.  Used it to make metal ABC roof panels to fit, no issues.  Fit my Rigid drill with no problems"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased three of these lights to replace some cheap outdoor lights on the front of my house.  I am very pleased with these lights.  They look great, work great, and are reasonably priced.  The instructions are well written and installation was a snap.  You will want to experiment with the sensitivity setting to suit your needs.  When set to the most sensitive setting, the lights were picking up passing cars on the street, so I had to use the mid-range setting, which detects moving objects on my property but not in the street.  The lights seem to be of good quality and should last many years beyond the manufacturer's warranty."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a 75 year old and assembled this product myself. I sat down, placed all the pieces on the floor, in order and simply followed the directions. I used a hammer covered with a sock and it worked just like a rubber mallet. I didn't want to make holes in my bathroom wall, so this product works perfectly for me. It looks modern and matches with all the bronze accessories in my guest bathroom and have gotten compliments from guests already. Thanks Amazon. I always find what I need at Amazon. Packaging and delivery were great too."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"I was very satisfied with these lights having instant brightness when they came on, but then without any warning they just went out and would not come back on. They were only on my garage for 1 year. I will not take another chance buying this brand again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"first, packaging was TERRIBLE. i know it's a large item, but it was put in two boxes (side to side) and taped with clear packaging tape. just for that they should get 2 stars. a kid would be able to package it better. just terrible.

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

i'd buy it again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very good LED lamp for the price. Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.

Pros:
The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base.
The light is very steady and there is no flicker.
The controls are easy to learn and access.
The finish is nice.
The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications.
The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles.
The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.

Cons:
The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base.
The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish.
The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in.
The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.

I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not. But at least you never have to change a light bulb!
Good value for money and a recommended product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Replaced a single pole switch with this product. High ceiling made it difficult to control fan light and speeds. This upgrade was simple to install resulting in a compact and modern look compared to the single switch it replaced. I changed all the switches with Lutron products (i.e., dimmer switches) during this project and couldn't be more happier with this decision.

The fan light and speed selection is responsive, the remote unit was small compared to others I have installed making it easy to place in the canopy.  I placed the remote control unit on the wall at the other end of the room with velcro allowing the fan to be controlled at the two main entrances.

I liked this solution so much, I ordered two more units, but unfortunately not from Amazon, since the price increased from $85 to
$116 in just two weeks between the time I ordered, installed and wrote this review.  I found them for less than $80 at dimndimmer, so I went with them; however, my primary shopping place is Amazon."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I recently relocated to another city which meant I had to relocate my home (garage) wood shop.  My new garage has 9+ foot side walls so I decided to take advantage of this height by storing lumber on these Triton racks high on the wall.  I could not be more pleased with this product.  Assembly was very easy, although I had to wait a day to install them as there were no lag bolts included for mounting.  Properly installed, this lumber rack is VERY strong and stable.  I highly recommend it!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Not a lot to say here - it's a Mora, it's razor sharp right out of the box and it does a million things great! Perfect camp knife (you're not going to be processing tons of firewood, but it can baton smaller kindling) and the fire steel can be sparked right off the spine of the blade. Definitely a place in every woodsman or fisherman's kit."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,Although it is a very nice item. It was missing the short extension poll and after it was assembled and the box had been tossed; I noticed a crack in the glass fixture.  I checked the upper part but did not Check the bottom part where the chain was.  This is so large I would like a glass light replacement.

These bulbs had claimed all that I was looking for. Color, dimmable, and lumens. But, in reality, they are: GU10 LED bulb replacements, are dimmable, are the right color, but are most definitely not anywhere near the lumen output that is claimed. Actual measurement was 210 lumen each.

Overall the light is bright and warm. I gave this 4 star instead of 5 because of the defect experience.

Update 6/13/16
Received the replacement bulb. Now everything are working as they are supposed to.

Update 8/11/17

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.  What a joke......

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,Posting was misleading in that it stated it to be 8' long and didn't mention the stretchable to part. Thought I was getting a fixed length 8' but it still works OK all the same.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Great product, Used it everyday from about 7 months with no problem. NOTE: it may not be as effective on measurements of less than 5 inches.."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I'm very happy with these inexpensive manifolds. However, my crimper does not fit once the first line is crimped on (copper rings). I have a custom made threaded-bolt crimper that I bought from eBay - it's a life saver and fits perfectly into these small manifolds. The guy makes them on a CNC machine. The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with the toolmaker, but your standard crimper may not work."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These booties have come in handy as I've had electricians and plumbers doing some work on the house. I have light colored floors that show dirt easily so these kept the floor clean. The workmen were surprised I had these booties but they wound up liking them so much that they took the them for future jobs.

The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.

The quality is good. They have light treads though not sure if they make much of a difference in grip.

The only thing is that you have to get over your initial embarrassment at asking people to put them on. Still, it's better than asking folks to take their shoes off."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased 2 of these back in October of 2007.  I totally like these seats but unfortunately one of the seat's ""Quiet-Close"" mechanisms has failed.  Had these for almost  9 years.  Not too bad but would have expected  a non failure for the cost.  But, I like them so much I will probably be replacing the bad one soon."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Appear to be of good quality.  They are going to be exposed to winter weather so we will see how well they hold up after winter in the northeast.  For now Ill givr it 5 stars but will update if they don't hold up.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I would like to tell you that I used this and love it, but by the time I found this, ordered it, and finally received it, I was done with my particular job.  What I see here is a perfect looking replacement for the 10-15% silver content rod that we all pay thorugh the nose for normally.  Forney promises that this will do just as well...... my best guess based upon previous Forney products used is that it will be equal, or very likely,.... a bit better than the expensive stuff.  However that may be, I do NOT know that for sure yet.  I do not need it it right now, and have no jobs in the immediate future to do so.  Later on, if I find it is a lot better, I will find and update this posting.  I do hope it helps someone out there who is fearful of it failing.  As I said, the Forney name is why I bought it, and based upon my history with Forney, this is good stuff and will save you a LOT of hard earned money to do the same job just as well!  Enjoy."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Manufacturer will not honor their warranty.  My thermostat gave out in less than a month, and they won't do anything about it.  I sure wish I had bought it on Amazon instead of the HVAC thief that sold it to me."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Give a nice dull light on top of the pillar.  More light would be nice, but for the price it is what I expected.  By no means is this light to assist in vision, just to create a barrier.
Edit: purchased 4. Lights quit recharging within 6 months. Do not have access to batteries. Very cheap and poorly made. I would not buy again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,This was a replacement for the same pump that I have under my house for our dehumidifier.  It works great and gets all the water out and away from our house.  Very easy to install and wire.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Well ok, I got it quickly and it looks nice, but I bought it without really thinking. This requires a 3 hole sink which isn't what I bought and by the time I'd gotten around to putting everything together it was too late o send this back. Lesson learned, but like I said it looks nice. Im sure it works..lol.."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,OEM parts at a reasonable price and quick shipping.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

Overall, it's a good buy, but only time will tell how it will hold up."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,This didn't seem to work for what I needed it to clean. I am trying to get out set on hard water stains and yellowing from marble. This product didn't seem to help. I think I'm going to have to call a professional.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,THIS HEAVY DUTY EXTENSION CORD IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE ORDERED.....PERFECT FOR RUNNING ALONG A WALL WITH THE PLUG IN CONNECTOR ON TOP.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Good price point and some nice color options.  Use to change the colors on the front of the house as the seasons change.  Green for St. Patrick's Day, Red for Valentines Day etc.  And being LED not so bad on the electric bill.  First one lasted me a few years."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"This would be great if I wasn't going to be home and wanted lights going on and off at various times during the day and night. But what I want to use it for is to run a water distiller for exactly 5 hrs. The other type of timer was not accurate. This one is, but each time I want to run it, I have to set the time to go on and then off and verify the day and the schedule. The next day always at a different time than the previous day, when I want to run the distiller for five hours, I have to set the timer again as to what time it should go on and then off and also set the day for it to run and whether it should repeat everyday, every other day etc...all settings that are insignificant to me.

I wish I could just set to run for five hours and have it turn off afterwards. It was a lot of money to pay for for what I needed: a simpler setup. I am sure it is great for turning lights on and off randomly, as it says it does.

I have it plugged in an outlet under a wall cabinet which has a light under it but I have to use a flashlight to view the digital screen. It protrudes beyond where the light can shine on it.

When setting the times, if you go past the number you wanted, you cannot reverse it, but have to go all the way around the 12 hrs to get back to the number you wanted. This goes for hours and minutes, days of the week etc, for each of the on and off settings. Kind of a hassle. Anyone know of a simpler timer?"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,We love these lights. Seem to be good quality and they're always a subject of interest when we have guests. Everyone loves them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"As some other reviewers have said, save your money and get just the basic version.  I can see that if you were doing many many drawers of exactly the same size that the deluxe version would come in handy.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I never got this product from this vender.  CT Power Tools informed me within a day or two that the product was out of stock and they were uncertain how soon they might have it, that it was probably going to be a month or two. I canceled the order and resourced it.
I would and probably will do business with this vender again as I very much appreciate their timely responses and honesty."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,Sometimes a little difficult to get the right bite.  A little uncomfortable after a couple uses.  But you rarely have to use one of these.  And a lot of fittings come with this already.  So now I have a small jar full of them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I hate buying tool accessories but this thing is great. It works as well as I do and saves time. I love the easy rise system but I had to make some metal mounts so it would work with my Hitachi first gen 8&1/2 inch sliding compound saw. I really didn't like setting up my saw for precision cuts before. It always took too long, too much stuff, and too much time. Now I just roll it into the truck and away I go and the supports slide out far enough to actually help. I would have preferred it be a little narrower, and as others have said, solid tires instead of inflatable. Its really heavy but it's easy to move around and saves me time every time I use the saw. Would buy another if this one broke."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have had this air hose for about a year now, and have nothing bad to say about it. It does its job, doesn't kink, and is easy to coil up and store on a hook.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I can enter my parking garage using a key, or remotely using the garage door opener (I have a 3089 10-pin opener).  Since entering is easier via the remote door, I was hoping to find a small remote that I could fit into my pocket so that I could keep the main opener in the car, and use the smaller one as a key.

I was a bit skeptical that this little device would work, but it works perfectly.  You just open it up, program the pins, and it's good to go. I've only tested the range from ~ 2 car lengths (b/c that's all I need) but from that range it works flawlessly.

Oh, and kudos to North Shore Commercial Door for fast processing/shipping. Ordered it on Wed and received it on Sat."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away.  I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.  It is now at the perfect ""peace of mind level"" where it is high enough in the sump that it won't sound off unless the sump pump fails to work."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"What to say, they are the bulbs I use as vanity lights, give good clear light, which for my eyes is super."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"The voltage tester works ~20% of the time and has to be held just right on the 12/2 and 14/2 wire I tested it with.

Feels very cheap and made out of very cheap / fragile plastic. Throwing it in a tool bag would probably damage it.

There is no way I would trust it to be accurate and use it in any situation. It is a dangerous device in my opinion and will frequently give ""False negative"" readings - indicating there is no power running through a wire when there actually is.

On a positive note the flashlight works so there is that..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Worked great for our broken sliding glass door lock. Just measure the distance between the screws on yours and you can replace yours with the correct one. It is a bit tight, but that's to be expected since its new. Beats having to pay $100+ for a handyman or locksmith to come out and replace. Replacing is as easy and backing out the bolts on the handle, pulling the old on out and inserting the new. Hope to get 10+ years out of this one like the old one!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"After doing some research I definitely wanted a dual sensor smoke alarm which this is.  My understanding is that it is more likely to catch different types of fires like open flame vs slow smoldering.  We bought an older house that only had one alarm.  I decided that wasn't good enough in case that one ever failed we would be in trouble if we ever had a fire.  So, I got three of these to add to the house.  Installation and battery insertion is very easy.  The other question is... do they work?  Yes, they do... we were cooking in the oven and food bubbled out onto the oven elements causing smoke.  They did there job and went off.  But, once I took them outside they immediately stopped beeping.  So, they definitely work!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using a Lansky sharpening stone for years, and I never expected to buy another because they last forever!  However, we moved last year, and it got lost. I wasn't sure a new one would have the same quality, but all this is missing is the smoothed over wear marks. If you need to sharpen axes, shovels, hoes, or any other garden tools, this is what you need."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Considering all the tools in my garage, this planer and the Dewalt 12"" sliding compound miter are the best investments I have made.  The only thing I am going to change is to put a spiral cutterhead in it.  If you have the wood bug hobby, this is THE planer to buy, short of a commercial machine.  I purchased this from Amazon on Jan 26, and it was delivered on Jan 30.  This is a good compromise of size and cutting capacity for a home or garage workshop.  I bought a dust collection adaptor to fit this to my shop vac, even though it says not to.  It fills up my shop vac pretty quickly, but it works.  I use very small increments of wood removal, and am able to get wood planed down to a perfect .500"" when measured with a dial caliper.  For fitting into 1/2"" cut dados, I couldn't be happier.  I've been using this on top of the table saw for a flat level surface, until I can make a sturdy wooden stand for it.  There are aftermarket carbide blades from Infiniti tools if you prefer not to double the value of the machine by buying a spiral cutterhead."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"We had one of the lamps that would die after less than an hour but Amazon sent out 4 replacements along with a shipping label to send these back.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.  It is well worth the money. It is the brightest motion sensor light I think I have ever seen. Thanks for a great product."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"The OxyLED SL30 is a shining star in the field of compact LED outdoor illumination. I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor lights in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

The only thing that could make this better would be a remote solar panel. I have a few areas that just don't get any direct sun and a LED unit like this would be perfect with an 8-10ft panel extension."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is the one flashlight you need for all occasions.  Is it bright?  Eye-popping bright!  5 modes including an SOS signal. Only 6"" long, so can fit in a back pocket OK.  Waterproof, although I haven't tested this feature.  Requires just one battery, which happens to be a size 18650 not found readily in the USA.  (But can be ordered with charger from Amazon.) I am really impressed with these CREE LED flashlights.  Forget about the 9-LED flashlights, and any old-model incandescent flashlights!  They just don't compare at all to these CREE lights. WOW!  Amazon ships directly from China; about 2 weeks for delivery.  Always well packaged.  btw, buy extra batteries."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"It works as advertised, but the brush is extremely soft and takes more effort to use than I would like.  I guess I just prefer a stiffer brush for my work.  If you have a lighter touch and don't manhandle the brush like I do, it may be a good fit for you.
I had some trouble with the first brush, but the seller was immediately there to try and resolve the issue.  He sent me another brush and assured me that it was a very rare manufacturing anomaly.  He even went so far as to focus on looking to see what may have happened at the manufacturing facility.  I only mention this because if you are even remotely thinking about purchasing this, you can with confidence as the owner/CEO stands firmly behind his invention."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,better be flat and level when you bring it down  or the battery could knock the door open  and it will break that latch
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is a high quality product but one problem that could make is a ONE STAR purchase. I am very pleased, well made, bright chrome with a great basket strainer. After I installed the sink with strainer stopper down would not hold water, A full sink would leak out in an hour. Problem easy to solve!  The strainer has a slight tolerance defect that is easy to fix. The bottom of the strainer is slight bowed up holding the stopper too slightly too high so the water leaks out. Put the strainer on top of the open jaws of a vice and center a socket  over the stopper handle at the center of the strainer then hitting it downward. This causes the strainer bottom to now bow down a bit. This allows the O-ring to seat properly, problem solve. Yea water stayed in the sink all night. You will need to replace the O-Ring each year or worse case every 6 month. Bottom line I love this product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"It seemed like a cool idea not to have to use threaded pipe for bar clamps and they have been working fine more or less, but I don't like the way the clamp head flops around while you're trying to line things up. Maybe I'm just used to the way the threaded type heads stay put while you're cranking on them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Love Knipex tool line.  I have many of their products and they are always the first tool I reach for.  Very high quality at a reasonable price.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"today helped one of the guys at work put up posts for his fence in the back yard.  i brought this to help with a straight post line.  the area for the posts was not level, in-fact it was lumpy and bumpy.  for he said he will level the yard after the fence is up.  so i folded down the little feetters , turned it on and right away saw the red laser line.  we augered the holes via per the lazer line.  put the posts in the holes and poured the cement.  after the posts were setting, we used another lazer to see how accurate this was.....DEAD ON....  this work buddy has such a straight fence line that his neighbor came over and asked if we could set his posts for his fence.  this is easy to use and no matter what terrane it sits on you will get a perfect straight line.  this really beats using the older lazer level.  since it is made by bosch you can be rest assured that the quality is in the product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Its does a good job sharpening and is reasonably priced. It is superior to diamond sharpeners because the belts can be changed and replaced. I got one for myself and my son-in-law.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,The price was fantastic!  The crisper is an exact match for our broken one.  Very happy with this purchase and this seller shipped super fast!!!!!  A+++++++++++
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"2 of these bulbs died within a few weeks in this 8pack so it pretty much was a waste of a deal for me. Also, these bulbs were a little too 'white' in terms of their brightness. I think I'll pass on these things next time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this last week because I am working on a 12ft high x 36ft long x 4ft deep childrens playhouse.  There was no way I was hammer nailing all of the roof shingles, trim, etc...  So I went on line and saw this package.  Let me say that it is AWESOME!  It looked brand new.  There was no visual signs of any prior use.  Other than ""Inspected by 3-1"" stickers on everything you would think it was brand new.  I have used over 4000 Finish Nails, and over 2500 Finish nails since it arrived (I haven't used the stapler yet).  It has performed flawlessly.  I am so glad I got it.  It is a great value!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This is a neat little knife that fits in my pocket almost unnoticeable. The way the blade folds in though, the edge of the blade is a bit exposed and I have nicked my finger a few times reaching into my pocket. The blade doesn't fold into the knife like an ordinary folding pocket knife, that's why it can be so thin. Still handy though."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Only have had for a week, but working very well. Great for use next to bed to charge devices overnight with built in USB ports. And great price. I would recommend to other and purchase again myself."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This little light has a surprising intensity. It is our 4th modern LED flashlight purchase and made a great Christmas present for a working guy. LED Lenser and Coast Cutlery of Portland Oregon make truly awesome hand held flashlights of every size imaginable. One day I'll have an X-21 !  Check out the company web site and don't miss the photo documented illuminating night scenes. ""[."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,This works very well for us. We have a well and I worry about contaminates. The water tastes different after filtering. It tastes much better and cleaner. I have had well water most of my life but after moving to a different home the water did not taste good at all but this takes care of that. The water flow does slow down after about 6 weeks or so for us. We replace the filter every six to eight weeks. We have been using these for about 4 years now and will continue using.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I don't know how so many lumens can be produced by a light using 1 AAA battery.  Quality could not be better.  A little pricey.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Love this tool and have carried it daily for about 7 years. They have weak jaws if you twist--I've broken many of them, but they are intended to be lightweight so shame on me. Have also snapped some blades (but I've abused them). I also frequently catch the clip on my seat belt and bend it wide open. Leatherman has replaced at least 6 of these tools for me with refurbished ones. 4 stars because of the fragile jaws, otherwise I love it and use it multiple times daily."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,These work great. I have them on 4 sides of my shed and I can see from my house when something/someone is moving around the shed.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I only use these to spread glue. I tried to use them for painting and staining and it was a mess. Lots of hair kept coming out and they don't spread very well. For the price you can't beat it though. Arrived on time.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Works fine for my gate. I like it a lot more than the MasterLock of the same style, which I regrettably also bought. I would buy this product again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I finally picked up the black version off of Woot for a great price. The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"It is difficult to find bulbs that look like the ones shown in the picture.  I have gotten gold bulbs that are called amber, even with GE numbers that formerly corresponded to imprints on bulbs that look like the dark amber ones.  I have also searched imprinted dark anber bulb GE parts numbers and found a florescent bulb.

These bulbs are very price, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.

One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.  At least this seller could guarantee they were dark amber."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,really well designed.  easy to put together.  lots of power.  great rip fence capacity for the portability.  for me it was a toss up between this one and the bosch.  I worked with a guy that had the bosch so I used it quite a bit and it was pretty great but now that I have this model I don't think I would go back.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I only got to use this once to remove water from my inflatable swimming pool. I used to use buckets to remove water. That was a pain in the a$$ and my back. I should have bought this pump much sooner. Very fast and quickly removed the water. The pool was about 4' below the street level, so I had to buy some PVC pipes and fittings at local hardware stores (wasn't expensive). I don't know about reliability but I love this for now."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Bought this light and was very satisfied until it quit working. Leds flicker at less those that try to light but most don't even flicker. Have written company about light but at 29.99 you expect better performance . Dependng on response am not sure if I can recommend company and products. SkyGenius is replacing bulb with an upgraded version and this is satisfactory for me I can now recommend.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I am an elderly handicapped woman and I love this.  Very easy for me to use and I have used it a few times already.  Just put it on the charger - came pre charged and worked immediately.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"nice set of bungies, good heavy clips on the ends."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Got this the other day as a ""daily special"" for an extra $23 off.  VERY easy to install (especially after watching the short install video provided here on Amazon).  If I can install it successfully, ANYONE can.  I had more trouble getting my crusty 15-year old lock off than I did installing this one.

There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Bought all these direct from Cashco1000 seller here who offered a better value shipping (than 3.50 each) when they were called. (see Amazon policies on combining shipping): Rhino, Zebra, Blue and Gold McCaw, Beach sign, and Sea turtle. All made by clementine designs.
NOTE: I found out all Clementine fan pulls have gold chain.  Seller was very helpful since I wanted the chain to match the fan metal.
Also Bought their hotwheels Chevy SS on Silver chain~garage fabulous!  I live in Florida and every room has ceiling fans (some 2) which most have lights and fan pulls.  These are awesome! Adorable. The zebra and Rhino look the most juvenile of all but live together in a safari style fun room. They are a bit larger than I expected."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I used one of these to work on pc's so I didn't have to hold a flash light while screwing in parts. It's also great for walking the dog.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Works well for me. I plugged it in on the 2nd floor of a 4,000 square foot house that I own and it's great. It also lights up when the bell rings. Good value if you don't want to be bothered installing a whole new doorbell."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Works like a charm. Took about 30 seconds to program on my 10 y.o. Liftmaster opener. As advertised, with Amazon delivery and backing; I would buy again and would recommend to a friend."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Love this flashlight.  It is small enough to slip in your pocket and take wherever you might need it.  It is VERY bright (not to be looked into)!  It provides plenty of light and would seem to suffice for most any occasion, with bright, dim, and strobe modes.  It is very easy to operate with one hand and just seems like all the flashlight one would need in normal use."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"These do not stick well, and they do not hold my hand held shower head without falling off the wall. I would not buy this again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have a 2-step stool, but in an older home with high ceilings, it is often a few inches short of being able to reach all the places I need to reach to clean and replace bulbs or get things off of top shelves. This footstool is just the right height, sturdy, stable and folds up easily to tuck into a cupboard and out of the way."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great respirator. It fits very tightly and securely to my face: I plugged up the intake holes and could not get air in at all, even from the sides of the mask itself.

With the filters in place, breathing is easy. Exhalation is like breathing without a mask, and you can barely tell that there is a little extra work when breathing in.

On top of this, the mask is also pretty comfortable for a respirator. The silicon part that deals to your face is very soft."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Perfectly good curved log peeler. Blade comes in 'rough-sharp' condition. The better you are at sharpening, the happier you will be with this. If you can't sharpen, then you'll be happy with something else that comes razor sharp (until it dulls, then you're stuck since you DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN!!!)

I consider this a companion knife to a larger, straight blade drawknife but very worthwhile at $20."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"This cartridge is a piece of junk. The plastic stop on the stem keeps breaking. Other people have the same problem. (eg read the reviews on the Home Depot webpage.)  You can't even get the plastic stop itself, you have to buy the whole cartridge. Ridiculous."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,It works exactly as advertised and should be very useful for people who need help with their shower.  Good product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Came apart completely. Blew Across the Kitchen after 4 uses. Its 90% plastic 10% metal Certainly not the quality I expected from the great MOEN which costs 6x as much as a cheap Danco. No wonder an illustration is shown not an actual image of the item.  I will add my own.  I thought the bottom portion would be a beautiful chrome.  NOPE.  1970s kitchen plastic!

The concept is nice.
The less than fan shaped flow in spray mode is nice and more controlled that it is on a Danco&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danco-36325B-Swivel-Aerator-and-Sprayer-Chrome/dp/B000DZH9OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danco 36325B Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, Chrome</a>&nbsp;aerator and the pull push mechanism felt solid.  I did love the way it will stay in the spray mode, you don't have to keep pulling down on the fitting to move it from solid flow to spray time after time like you do with all the others on the market.  Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.

BUT
- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!  Ka Boom!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Great product, we live out in the country and have no city lights. For our dog that we allow to run off leash this works great. We can see him as would our neighbors be able to if he got into the road. The battery life is good but not awesome."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"awesome product.  works perfectly.  nothing more to say, we now have five of these scattered in the house. i guess the only negative is that they use up one plug."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,I use this to lift up a foldable trailer.  The rope is pretty rough and gloves are necessary.  It provides enough mechanical advantage to lift the tongue of the trailer up to vertical.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Worked perfect for blowing in insulation. Small masks did not cut it. They clog too fast.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"My favorite feature of LED lights is that the instant you turn them on, they're already at full brightness.  No waiting around.  Plus they use less energy!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Easy to setup, communicates with Insteon parts effortlessly.  Does get glitchy every now and then when configuring other switches (suddenly had 3 switches responding to 1 switch, ended up unpairing all of them and starting from scratch, then they worked correctly)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Very useful clamps. It's good to have a couple of long reach clamps
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Great lights. However the 18650 batteries WILL eventually lose the ability to hold a charge. I just replaced one after 3 years. Simple Phillips head screws and I like replacing with  EBL batteries. Much better than those cheap blue ones that come with it.
Update:just ordered four more to take care of more places that get dark. 4 for me and 4 for my new neighbor that doesn't know how to use the internet (she's 81) but wanted to get lights like mine. When I told her the price she was delighted (pun intended lol)

UPDATE: I have apparently the some of the  older models (bought 2 years ago) These NEW ones don't do what the old ones did. They only have ""on"" and ""dim to bright"" modes. My old ones had THREE settings. ON...dim to bright when motion is detected AND totally off and then bright when motion is detected. In the WINTER I need the last mode. I HATE when companies ""improve"" things. Probably due to the fact that people couldn't figure out how to use a bent paper clip to change the modes."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Cuts PEX, is cheap.  Not the easiest to use but for a DIYer like me it's perfect for the price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Solved the problems of all those little ""transformer plugs"" that seem to be on everything nowadays!! And take up the space of TWO regular plugs!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Excellent product. If you have good knives buy a good sharpener like this one.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!
(dropped it to 4 stars for the way they cheapened the mounting compared to the original, but I AM happy with the net result)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Not bad for the money, but not nearly as bright as claimed."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"The lights arrived quickly and, once we had enough sun, one of them worked great. To be fair, it has been cloudy and raining a lot lately and our house is surrounded by 80 foot oak trees that are several hundred years old so those trees also limit the light that reaches the solar cells that power this light.  The one light that worked great was the only one in a position to get enough sunlight. The rest were in shade all day and never came on. I'm going to move them around looking for a spot that gets enough sunlight."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Got as a gift for a cattle farmer who really puts these through a workout and they hold up!!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I moved an extremely heavy armoire with this handy device.  Fortunately, there was just enough space between the armoire and the carpeted floor to slip the lifter into place.  After that, it was pretty easy to push the lever down and slip the sliders into place.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase and glad I have this gadget in my tool box.  It will make furniture rearranging much less daunting."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased these tote boxes for an upcoming camping trip.  When I received them, I inspected them closely after reading several reviews that stated that the boxes arrived damaged.  Mine were packed well and there was no damage.  I expect that they'll get beaten up pretty good on our camping trip, so I made sure all of the lids fit securely.  To check the waterproof integrity, I sprayed water on them and the interior of the boxes stayed dry.  They stack easily and they appear to be very durable.  Overall I'm very happy with the boxes, especially at this price point.  I would definitely recommend them and will purchase again if I find myself needing more."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This is a good idea IF your saw motor is sealed or set outside the bag. It will catch most large wood dust but it is a pain to set up and take off in order to dump.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,best gloves I bought so far there perfect for almost all trades and gives you protection for you knuckles and there very durable
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"The bad:  it is a pain to turn on and off with heavy gloves on.  The app is worthless and is incredibly difficult to get the app to recognize the unit even after it is connected in the bluetooth menu.

The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.  They are too bulky to fit in my jacket pocket for work (plus require spare batteries) so they don't really compete well for most applications."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Not sure what to review, they are exactly what they say they are.  Work with the sharpmaker.  One end is marked red (I assume to tell between the ultra fine and the other stone which is white (fine)."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,It is a pretty simple device. For me the nice feature was the built in igniter. It is very reliable and easy to operate.  It keeps your hands away from the flame when you light it. Very handy for those that don't use torches a lot.

With this I can see any pressure drop in the filters which tips me off when they are starting to clog and need to be replaced. Much more accurate than just changing filters on a fixed basis. Decent quality, locked on to the pex with no issues."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Not too many people are using this system I'm thinking, but I do, good product, sturdy & holds up in the outdoor elements, reliable..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Quality hardware, and the quarter-turn valve works smoothly. One note of caution: this screws right into most faucets, but not all. If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).  It appears to have been a good decision for me.

I haven't yet had any problems with hard water so I haven't felt the need to move the unit to just the hot water pipe.

PS:  I installed the unit on my incoming copper water line."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,This was purchased for a Christmass gift. One of many gifts for my sons garage. Safety is important.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,It works perfectly and so much nicer then my old round black one.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I'm a mounted  mine in the center of my garage I have a large garage works perfect.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Now I can draw a straight and level line.  I'm happy.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"The real star in this kit is the Magnepull.  Incredibly strong magnet that will be sufficient for any type of pull in any given wall cavity.  The letdown is definitely the Magnespot which has a rather wide margin of errorabout 4 to 5 beyond the actual center, and a severely limited range of approximately 3.5 to barely 4, which is not enough to even get a reading through a average width wall with no insulation.  I would just save some money and go with the Magnepull kit by itself."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Awesome glass's...Everybody liked them so much I ended up ordering several for the guys and gals at work.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This grinder stand is excellent. It is heavy duty and able to accept many different grinders with the pre-drilled holes in the mounting plate.
Unfortunately, I own a Delta 8"" bench grinder and could only get three boltholes to line up. The fourth was on the rib of the base plate and could not be drilled. I mounted it with the three bolts and rubber grommets and all seems to be secure...considering.

Thinking about getting one for my drill press."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Love the lids for the microwave. They prevent splatter and help keep it clean. Easy to wash. Love the hanging hole - I have them hanging on the inside of a cabinet door.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"When you set the angle on this puppy, it does not let go.

I use it on a Sheppach wet/dry grinder (I refuse to pay $500 for the Tormek). It fit the Sheppach just fine, and the lock grips very strong.

The other day I had set the angle for my skew chisel to turn some pens. Right after I got it set, I picked up a large slab of Corian that was leaning against the grinder bench and whacked the toolrest with the Corian. The slab probably weighs 15 pounds, and the toolrest DID NOT BUDGE ONE DEGREE. Though I did dump water everywhere from the water pool.

I was pleasantly shocked."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Required ten minutes of assembly.  Long wanted a grinder, don't know why I waited that long.  At this price it makes no sense at all to be filing odd parts to debur and fit."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"not perfect as a style, but the tech is good"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Firstly these are great quality sockets,  the only draw back about the set is the case.  The sockets sit in kinda of a shallow valley when in the case, each has their place but if you are jar the case they can fall out of the case kinda easy.  Also the hinge of the case is a living hinge, meaning the hinge is just really bending plastic back and forth, without a hinge like a door hinge so to speak it really makes the case very suspect-able to wearing out as you bend the plastic to open the case and then have to bend the plastic back to the closing position. The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.  But for the price you really can't get a more better set for the price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

Now that the price has gone up  I should've went for a long swim that night."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Love the concept... but, be advised.. they do not work with GFI outlets."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Used these on two separate auto accidents that I happened to roll up on.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Great Product fast shipping just what i needed for my truck to comply with DOT would by again for all my trucks
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,As advertised. Used this to smooth out the rough edge on the cut side of porcelain tiles. Used while spraying water.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I bought the 1.28 flush version first bc I though how effective could a one gallon flush be...  Well I was so satisfied with the 1.28 gallon flusher that I had plenty of confidence going into the 1 gallon flusher.  It is very effective and handles ""all of the Yule logs that I throw down the chimney"" if you know what I mean.  I'll be buying another for sure"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,We went with a different set up but we are keeping these as we could use this in our kids play house. It's longer then we hoped for and a difficult application but if you need a universal bracket for the ceiling or end of window mounting this will work.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Awesome tool roll up. It is made for various types of tools. It is easy to put tools there and easily to see what tools are available. Good to have in your car or office. I recommend buying this.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"Terrible. Ugly, hard to work with and wY too long."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,What can I say.  Its a flashlight.  I bought this particular one because almost all my cordless tools are DeWalt 18 V  Maybe the next generation will have LED bulbs instead.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"AWESOME !! I'm 6'2"", almost hits knees. Very sturdy,  thick. This will last me forever. Very nice quality."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,I thought my metal table top was ready to use after one day of drying.  Wrong!  Cure time is 7 days!  I have use this product on other outdoor metal furniture.  It does OK stopping rust.  I have also used the spay-on black Hammerite which seems to be better at stopping rust.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"HELLO. THIS IS A GREAT SPOTLIGHT. MADE IN CHINA, SO THE COMPONENTS DONT FIT PERFECTLY, BUT AS A SPOTLIGHT GOES, IT ROCKS.
 THE CORD IS ABOUT 7 FOOT LONG AND THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER PLUG ARE HEAVY DUTY. IT HAS A LOOP TO HANG IT AND AN OFF / ON SWITCH THAT MAKES IT HANDY.  THE LENS GETS REAL HOT, BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED WITH 3 MILLION CANDLE POWER. IT REALLY,REALLY LIGHTS UP AN AREA BIGTIME. THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE PRICE. NO REGRETS.  A GOOD CHOICE FOR A GOOD LIGHT !"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent rework station. I highly recommend it. The extra tips and spares are a very thoughtful addition. My only critique is the plastic iron holder, I would pay a little more for this product for a metal iron holder but this is not enough of an issue to knock a star off. Update - purchased a 2nd one for another bench. Excellent product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"One of the best purchases I have made this decade.  I have a woman....and ""older"" woman who just does not have the grip that I used to for home repairs.  I have tried various electric screwdrivers from name-brand companies like Black and Decker but they just did not give me the push I needed.  A friend recommended this from across the Country, so he had to convince me that....no, it is not too heavy for me.  Yes, it is very easy to grip, load, and charge.  Yes, it has plenty of power and will hold the charge through all my projects!  He recommended that I just get a board and put screws in it, then reverse and take out.  I did....I only needed to do that twice before I was all over the inside and outside of my house taking care of those long-awaited projects.  I actually laid it down in the kitchen and forgot where I put in a week ago.  I thought I was going to go through withdrawal!  I have been using this tool at least every other day since I got it and am now creating new projects to use it with.  Trust this girl who has more power tools than most men!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Good tool! Takes the same battery pack as my other 18V Makita tools, which is a Very Good Thing. Well-balanced, strong, no excess vibration. Love it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Nice quality light... everything looks great and is well made. A few complaints though...

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Used for a project at an airport for indicator light and worked great.  Had enough room to fit a CFL inside too.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"works fine, i was cautious to get this one over the kline, but i'm happy i did, i scooped the replacements (Greenlee 9953-11 Replacement Blade for Conduit Reaming Screwdriver 9753-11C) as well, but haven't had to change em yet"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light. Place a few of these in some strategic locations, and you'll have no trouble navigating through your darkened house at night. Fumbling in the dark for the light switch will be a thing of the past. You get two for this great price. Have a basement? Get at least two more! Two of these has replaced four of the old style lights for me. I'll never go back!

I was given this product in return for my unbiased and honest evaluation."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This is really cool. Got it for my wife for our front yard. We put it up against our water fall. It is not real bright but enough that you can see it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Slightly dented when I got it.  It did the job though and now it is being used by my husband in his art studio.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,This is great for heat gun (SMA) applications.  The RMA flux is great for unsoldering the old parts and getting a clean pad;  RMA flux is mildly reactive which increases the wettability of metals .  Most SMA jobs are usually small so this is a lot of product for type of application.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"It seems reasonably well made, but they didn't mention that it takes a T6 bulb in the description. The body is too thin to accept anything else, e.g. a candelabra base flame bulb.

Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I prefer these because they are lighter weight than some of the higher capacity batteries on the market.  In things like saws and drills, I'd rather use a lighter tool so I can be more precise.  They charge so fast that you can just have a few on hand and swap them out as needed.  The only tool that eats through them quickly is my circular saw- the drills can drill hundreds of holes or drive hundreds of screws before needing changed.  If you are using it in something like a light or a vacuum, where weight is not a factor, I'd go for the higher capacity heavier batteries."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"There are a ton of reviews on this product already, 275 of which are five stars so I'm sure I'm not going to say anything that hasn't already been said but the utility of this tool deserves praise. For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price as a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box. The tool itself its light and thin which makes carrying it no different than adding another key to your key ring. Bottom line I don't know anyone who wouldn't benefit from adding one of these too their EDC."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Make sure you install it right but exactly what my old maglite called for, made a useless thing useful again. Love it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great tool to determine if the problem is a bad charger, or a bad battery. One can also detect if the capacity of a battery is starting to decline and prepare to replace the battery before it is completely dead."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Read instructions, test, and forget it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,not sure - didn't have any AAA batteries when power went out.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Lovely. I learned the hard way that the outside is glass. Not used to that on an LED. Very elegant light and look to fixture. These are in the powder room for all the visitors to see.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Disappointed.  It would not split some logs I could split with a maul.  The motor takes a couple seconds to spool up for each stroke, which is annoying.  The design requiring both hands to engage probably keeps some lawyer happy somewhere but is very clumsy to operate."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Out-freaking-standing...so far.  I haven't actually beat the crap out of it yet, but so far seems every bit as quality as my surefire at around $100 less of a price point.  Some may prefer the 2L, but I love the size and weight for a setup not requiring an extended burn time for (ie. home defense).  It mounts very well with the Magpul MLOK Offset mount.  I did make one small modification that would be nice to see from the factory as an option.  I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.  I do love the variety of attachment methods that they provide standard with the light.  It is an ideal switch type that comes with it that allows for both momentary and constant on.  I'm also a fan of the 10 tap system to adjust based on your individual preferences."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,Works great use it mostly to get excess water off of my pool cover in the off season and it works really well. I would recommend this pump
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Started getting into custom woodworking as part of my remodeling business.  First use of this was a small table top.  Setup was easy (RTFM), and worked well.  There is a little variation in the top-to-bottom location of the biscuit grooves but I expected to have to sand the top smooth anyway.  As stated in other reviews, the dust bag is useless.  It clogs up immediately.  At least the dust port shoots the debris a little to the side.  Second project was a 14' x 3' cherry bar top.  Again, required some sanding but came out awesome.  Checked back on it a year later and it was holding together very well, no signs of cracks or failed joints."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,Meh.  It came sharp.  Feels sturdy.  The blade shape makes it far wider than it needs to be and ends up being far too wide to carry everyday in my pocket.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Not bad!  Considering how much cheaper this cutter is that the ones at the big box stores (and even here on Amazon), this is a great value.  Made cuts just like it should.  Only reason for not getting five stars is that it's aesthetically rough... there's clearly no finish work done to this item once that stamp it out and assemble it at the plant... other than a quick, shabby paint job (which, for the record is orange, not yellow as in the picture)... but again, these are all issues with the way it looks, which I could care less about... It does the job, and it's way cheaper than it's closest competitor."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product)."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I needed a replacement sprayer in the Rubbed Bronze color and this worked great for my Pfister brand kitchen sprayer.  It does not have the hose included to make sure you are able to unscrew the old sprayer from the existing hose.  I also had to buy a rubber 'O' ring for inside the sprayer.  This one did not come with it, but I was easily able to find one at my local hardware store to fit it.  That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"We took a chance on theses -- 4000 K is VERY white/sunlight -- for a closet for which we never had enough light.  These are BRIGHT.  I am not sure I would want 4000K for a regular home area, but for this purpose they are fantastic.  After a couple of months, I still giggle at the burst of sunlight every time we turn on the closet light.  And we can now tell one color from another --- even dark blue from black.  Time will tell if they last as long as advertised, but for right now they are perfect for what we needed/wanted."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Perfect bulb for recessed lighting. I replaced my CFL bulbs and recommend these to everyone looking to upgrade to LED. The light output is superior to the CFL bulbs. It's amazing how these bulbs can transition a room from dingy yellow to warm white. Give them a try, you will really like the difference."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very handy work light.  You can use it as a flashlight, but I probably won't.  I have much brighter flashlights.  However, the three light wings on the sides are adjustable, and provide an excellent area light suitable for camping or working on my vehicle after dark.  I think we will carry this in out RV.  By the way, I spent ten minutes rapidly switching both switches in an attempt to duplicate the lock up problem others have reported, but it worked perfectly.  I will amend this review if that changes.  I took off one star because the magnet in the base needs to be stronger."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"You ever get sick of having to pay top dollar for a rechargeable battery? I know I do. But that is the reality and I am not willing to have to buy a whole new drill rig because it seem more economically feasible to do so instead of buying a battery that is about half the cost.

Well with this Pwr+ second market battery you don't have to any longer. After getting a case of sticker shock at the local Home Depot for a replacement battery for my DeWalt drill I thought there had to be options. There are and I found it right here.

Now there are multiple batteries available on Amazon for the DeWalt drill. So, how did I settle on this Pwr+ battery. I spent some time reading the product reviews and ultimately found that this particular aftermarket brand had high ratings and pleased customers that stated the battery not only charged well, but lasted as well.

For less than $30, I purchased this battery and received it within two days. (I have Amazon Prime). It charged and worked as I expected it to. You cannot go wrong with this battery and it has served me well thus far."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"I'm pretty handy, but this was impossible to use, and you'll live in mortal fear it may retract quick enough to slice open your hand. To be clear, it didn't cut me, but it retracts fast enough I believe it could."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like."

The cord makes the material bend down rubbing significantly against the top of my toe. I even tried on several more pairs with the same disappointing result. Love the look of the shoe and tried to think of some way to eliminate the problem.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,The fit and feel of the top are fine but it's see through so I won't be wearing it. I hate bras and this shirt needs a strapless bra. I got the Yellow color so maybe if you get a different color it will be wearable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Fits as listed, comfortable fit, but man they are stiff in the sole. You won't be breaking in the sole action for some time. Nice shoe though, I really like them for the occasional shop visit when I have toe up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Great thick quality! Well made. I never go wrong with Carhartt, have made many many purchases for many years. Never disappoint."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"The neckless and earings arrive in a nice black box, put a bow on it and give yourself a gift. The size of both are perfect, and they look like real diamonds. A great item to wear,  for casual or dressy outfits. I would give the earings 5 stars, but the neckless only 4 as it tends sometimes to flip down, somewhat covering the stone. This however should not be a deterence from buying the neckless and earings, as they are both a great deal!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Nicely made. Thin, but enough cushion to make slight impact."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"it's a carhartt what can i say , great product's"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I usually wear a size 36 x 34 in all my jeans regardless of brand, so I ordered accordingly for the Silver Zac jeans. While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect. Just make sure to go down one full size in order to achieve the optimal fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,Shoes arrived on time but in a torn and very beat up box.  Shoes arrived dirty.  No receipt included in package and it appears shoes have been worn.  Dirt all along rim of shoe.  Disappointed to say the least
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,I bought it 3 months ago and it is already stretched out. But was cute in the beginning
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These black Signature by Levi Strauss & Co jeans are good for wearing under long sweaters or tops that hit mid thigh. They are not as heavy as normal jeans but they are thicker than jeggings and leggings, and fit like skinny jeans. There is quite a bit of stretch though so over time the rear end gets a little saggy. But overall, they are nice for the price and will hold up well if you don't plan to wear them every day."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These are SO comfortable. Like walking on a marshmallow with butter between your toes! But not quite that messy or gross. Just trust me, they are so soft and easy to wear with just about anything. I bought these in black and grey (which is actually white) and love them both!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,These are perfect for kayaking but are a little shorter and smaller than expected
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,very good bag..nice and big but not too big and has a wonderful zipper.  would recommend it highly to anyone.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"BEST SHOES EVER.  I HAD A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT AND I HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT SHOES.  I ALSO NEED A LEFT KNEE REPLACEMENT, WITH THESE SHOES MY KNEES FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.....  GREAT SUPPORT, COMFORTABLE., STYLISH.  I LOVE THEM.  I WISH I COULD GET AT LEAST (8) MORE PAIR IN DIFFERENT COLORS, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THEM.  THEY ARE A LITTLE TIGHT ACROSS THE TONGUE OF THE SHOE, BUT I WORE THEM A FEW TIMES AND THEY ARE PERFECT NOW.  PLEASE MAKE THESE SHOES FOREVER!!  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT GO-WALK, TRY THEM YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED, I PROMISE!!!!!!!!!!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Love this base shirt. Wear it under stuff, and by itself. Doesn't shrink, always fits perfect and it's very soft."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Medium fits a small male such as myself (5'5 120 pounds).
The inside is really soft too."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is my third pair and I could not be happier.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Loved it. Worked well with my formal dress for a black tie formal event.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Very tight around the ankle, which is a problem I've never had."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"A little on the small size but as to be expected since it says that it is fitting... its also pretty thin and feels more like costume material which for some reason I didn't expect.. still cute, it'll work!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,For Tevas I thought they were cheap made and loose.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,My daughter has small and narrow feet-these fit well and do not slip off as much. The heel-strap is padded and comfortable. Very cute :) I got size 4/5 and she is 12 months old.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"The fit is more or less fine, though the lack of choices for inseam sucks. The drawstring legs are useless, and beyond stupid. I just jerked out the drawstrings and cuffed the legs for now until I can have them hemmed properly.

Not a fan of the useless pockets below the knee, either. Anything you put in there is going to flop around and be general pain in the ass, so why even bother putting a huge cargo pocket there? a small tight fitting pocket there would have been a better choice, but... Again, useless and stupid."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,The jeans fit great and very comfortable. Also good price.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This is an awesome shirt! I purchased this for my husband in the black and I have to say it is one of my very favorites in his wardrobe. We live in So. California where it is virtually always warm and my husband literally lives in shorts & tee's year round. He needs many shirts & shorts so I stay on the lookout for attractive clothing that will also be comfortable for him. The shirt is true to size (my hubby wears a size XL) and washes up wonderfully, keeping it's color and shape. It has an attractive mint green palm tree motif on the front that make me think of wonderful days on the beach! If you are looking for a gift or to purchase this shirt for yourself, I highly recommend!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love this watch!!  Also great price!  I also bought the white with rose gold.  Would buy this style and brand again!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I wore these all over Vienna, Austria and Munich, Germany and even on a mile and half hike (didn't know it would be thar far) and they were quite comfy throughout.  I did need bandaids for some blisters but they weren't bad blisters just the hike was too much I guess.  They are cute and chic and good for walking just not extremely long steep walks"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,100 percent satisfied. The quality is great. I have it as a gift and plan to order more. It even came with 2 extra chains that were different lengths.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these socks for my husband.  He is a runner and is outside all the time.  He sweats a lot and it is very damp where we live all the time.  His feet were always squishing in cotton socks and his socks were nasty in the laundry.  He insisted on his thick cotton Thorlo socks because they had padding where he liked it for long runs.  Finally!  I came across this moisture wicking Thorlo sock that has most of the same padding especially in the bottom areas.  He put them on after a race.  Now, let me tell you after a race, he is sweating so much he looks like he just stepped out of a shower.  Amazingly, his feet remained dry even though he was soaking wet everywhere else.  Afterwards, these socks did not pollute the laundry basket like the soaked cotton socks.  His only concern is they don't have quite as much padding on the top of the sock as his other cotton Thorlos so they may not be good for running down hills, but we don't have a lot of hills where we live.  So that isn't a problem unless we start travelling to running races again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,this watch exceeded all expectations wife loved it hello kitty fans just buy it
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love it! Perfect size and minimizes with no wire! I've never had success with that. I will be buying more soon!!!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This fleece doesn't have that ugly bally look that most fleeces have. It's smooth and the ""fur"" on the inside is a little long but smooth and cute. I ordered the size I wear in all my tops and it for perfectly whether I had on just a t-shirt or layered sweaters under it. I love that it zips up high on the neck. I bought it for a ski trip and with it under my coat I was very warm and comfortable even after falling in the snow (multiple times lol). This fleece is perfect"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this hat to wear on a three-day stay at the Western Southern Tennis Tournament in Mason, Ohio.  It performed beautifully through sunny, rainy, and sometimes very windy weather.  Good thing for the chin strap because you would not want the hat to blow off while sitting up high in the stadium seats.  I noticed other tennis enthusiasts had similar OR hats, but I was very pleased with mine and glad I purchased it online.  And it's a good thing the hat can be put into a washing machine because it did get a little dirty after three days of wear.  The best feature of the hat is that the back extends down far enough to cover the neck and keep it from being burned by the sun.  The adjustable chin strap and the toggle at the back allow you to get a fit exactly to your head size that is comfortable and stylish at the same time."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is the second pair of these that I get. They are great and this new model is even better than the first. They have added spring hinges now!  Awesome set of polarized shades!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Great scarf. I use this scarf when working with hay in the barn. Hay dust is a real problem but this scarf makes it easy to deal with.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Non steel toe. Fits well as long as you follow the sizing chart. #9 for a USA 10
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These are great!  Stitching was without an issue - and does what I needed it to do - keep my head from burning on long summer runs.

As an added bonus - I've found if I take my water bottle and pour it on my head - these stay wet for quite a while as well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Wife seems to like them, and they seem to be holding up after a month+ of daily wear...Fur isn't real, but overall they're nice"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this. I just wanted a regular money clip. However, when I saw the credit card slots, I thought this may work better than a typical clip. Am I glad I gave it a try! No more money balling up in my pocket, or dropping credit cards out of my pocket! This little guy is awesome! Great color and stitching. Seems like it will hold up for a good while!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I got these to replace a pair of grey suede boots that I loved but that have worn out.  I have slender legs and have trouble finding boots that fit my calves without making me look like I'm standing in two buckets.  These are fine tucked into skinny jeans.  The heel is a reasonable height, and they are pretty boots.  Contrary to what one reviewer said, I believe the suede portion is real but the buckel trim is man-made.  The boot does say ""leather/manmade upper).  They didn't have the boot in 7.5 so I got size 7 and they fit fine.  Nice boots on sale at a very reasonable price."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Ordered these for my son. He loves them! Says they are the most comfortable boots he has ever warn. He did say they are a bit more ""cowboy boot""  looking than he thought they would be. Other than that, no issues."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I finally got to apply this to a new pair of shoes.  Unfortunately, the cap/nozzle had come off in shipping.  I figured no big deal and put it back on.  But once I started spraying this, I ended up with a ton of it just running down the sides of the can.  So yes, my shoes are great, but it's frustrating I lost so much of the material running down the sides while I was spraying it.  Apparently the nozzle couldn't just be put right back on, though I've done it without a problem on other aerosol cans.  Wish I hadn't waited to use it on new shoes as now return period is past."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Paid half the price here on amazon to replace the pair I lost! Love them!!!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"It was a gift, I didn't get any feed back."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Really love this bra. Material is really thick and not cheap. Did not expect that. Its just a little tight on the sides I guess order one size bigger.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I love Minnetonka shoes! They always look refreshing and no one else has them!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have worn a size 10 since I was 10 years old, so I ordered a size 10 and kept my fingers crossed that they would fit. They run slightly small, but I can still wear them as long as I wear thin socks. My wife wears a 9 or 9.5 and she says that the 10's fit her The boots themselves are really cute and the zipper makes it easy to get them on and off. They look great with jeans and I'm sure they'd look great with leggings, if I wore them. There isn't a lot of cushion, but I'm comparing them to Ahnu boots, which may be a class of their own."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Ordered for wife who insisted her size would be XL but this turned out to be too small for ALL THREE SHIRTS I ordered for her birthday in October. Will be returning all 3 for exchange credit. She can't decide which way to go right now so will probably opt for straight return for a gift card. Too bad, too. She LOVED the colors, but they were simply too tight."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I Was Looking For -
1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight

PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company.
Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.

CONS
1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there.
2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access.
3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.

OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.

I will use the bag as a day travel purse in crowded cities. If you are not opening it much, It will work great as a day carry bag for sure."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This hat is awesome!!! It has truly exceeded my expectations. Great detail, very sturdy, a all around great hat that my son LOVES. It is not a cheap costume accessory, but an awesome cowboy hat that is well made and will receive lots of play!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Cheap (not just inexpensive, but ""looks like it came off a bargain-basement table piled high with other chintzy merchandise"" cheap). NOT a turtleneck , more like a mockneck or a ""funnel neck"". Wish I'd read the description: the ""turtleneck"" is 1 1/4"" tall, not a turtleneck by any stretch of the imagination. It gaps oddly at the sides so it looks like you're wearing it backward. I'm 5'2, 105 lbs, 32"" bust, and it fits like it was painted on."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"These shorts ""ride down"" for some unknown reason. I would avoid buying them. I only wear them for non-activity based ""lounging""."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"About me:  I do not call my self a runner.  When I run, I like to trail run.  I typically do 3+ miles every weekend.  I have done three Spartan races and am training for a Beast this month, so I've tapered up to 13.2 miles.  I'm 46 and could still stand to drop about 20 lbs.  5,8"" and 190 lbs.

I have ran two Spartans in the Reebok All-Terrains, and loved them...except for the support.  They are definitely minimalist shoes.  That's exactly why I bought these.  As much as I love the Reeboks for what they do well (grip, drain, etc.), my knees need more cushion.  I did a ton of research and came to the conclusion that the Salomon Speedcross 3 has the most cushion of any trail shoe.  I've now ran in them on four separate occasions, and did my longest run ever in them.  They will be my shoes for the Spartan Beast this month.  My expectation is that they will do as well as my Reeboks, but with more support."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I wear XS for everything  All the reviews I read said that this particular item fits smaller, but for me it fits as it should."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I absolutely love these shoes.  Its like they have springs in them, walking takes less effort.  You know how when you get off a trampoline its hard to walk, you're feet feel heavy and clunky?  That's how I felt after taking these shoes off.  You just bounce right along on them.

My feet never got tired after a full day walking, my muscles were a little sore the next day.

I agree with everyone else, they run a little small so go up a half size."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Great cardigan. I am 5'4, 157lb and a 36B- I got a large and this fit me perfect. I've tried it on with short and long maxi dress and looks great with both. Nice material that I think will be long lasting."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I'm glad I got the small/med. It Is a little big but perfect for a tall women if you are under 6ft.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,I am currently deployed and I was excited to receive these but when I did I was quite disappointed. The inside bottom sole of the right shoe is lifted from the bottom of the shoe and not fully glued on. I can lift half of it off. I'm nervous to wear these because I feel that the inside will get worn pretty fast and start sliding and coming out easily oppose to if it were made and glued down properly. I tried them on for a brief minute to see if the sizing was good and that was fine so no complaints there. Still not sure what to do with these. I'm really debating on sending them back but the process to do so from overseas is a little difficult.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My second purchase of Flap Happy and I love it.  Super soft, great quality, great price on this one.  Very happy and will purchase more of this brand."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This shoe is very nice.  The fit is great, I have a wide foot & they fit & feel wonderful!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These pants fit very well. I'm thinking about ordering more colors. The only downside id's that they seem to attract more pet hair than other materials.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These fit my waist size 30 women's jeans, I purchased the size 13 Juniors. I'm 5' 3"" and 155 lbs., these make me look taller and skinnier and make my butt look nice! I had to hem them just an 1 1/2"" and with my platform 4 inch heels, they look great!!! The dark wash, stretchy jean, flare style is right on trend! Received compliments from guys and girls! Get these girls, you'll be so happy and stylish!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Not as pictured. Ordered for the purples and blues, received oranges and blues"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Worked perfect for my sons field trip. Where we live it doesn't snow much and hasn't rained much this year so I couldn't really comment on it's durability but it fit my 10 year old (he's a little on the smaller side) perfectly. I purchased it for a week long ""outdoor school"" trip that the schools entire 5th grade class went on and the teacher commented on how much better this coat was compared to the coats that some of the other students had brought for the cold weather."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These things are awesome! Great for guys (or gals) who don't want to wear hats in the winter but need to keep their ears warm! You probably can't go out for long hours in sub-freezing temps but walking around in the city or going from car to restaurant, these will do the job.  I love that i can just snap them onto my ears and go and then take them off in a flash! Very functional and worth the purchase! I have average size ears and the medium are perfect!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,This looks like an okay shoe. I usually wear 990 womens 10. 5B or 10. 5D (whichever I can find in a bright color). These Leadville mens 8. 5D were too narrow across the ball of the foot.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"These are strictly for water aerobics. For that purpose that have a nice snug fit. I did have to take the liner out to improve the fit, but the surface underneath is fine for water walking/running. Do not think they would be comfortable for other purposes unless I exchanged for a larger size."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work. The soles, glue, and stitching are all in fine shape even after all that abuse."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I love these lightweight cardigans. I now have 3 short sleeve and 4 long sleeve. My only complaint is the size difference between medium and large. I have one long sleeve in medium and while it fits perfect it can be slightly snug on my upper arms over other shirt (light weight) sleeves so I then ordered the 3 pack in large and while it fits much better around my upper arms, it's a little too baggy in the forearm area and very long past my fingertips so I feel the proportions are just a little off. I still LOVE them though. These cardigans are silky smooth and soft and extremely comfortable and also drape very nicely."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,I read reviews and was advised to order a smaller size- man... was that the wrong move. Order in your cup size or it will be an immediate return.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Really love this purchase-so comfortable and washes well.  Great buy.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I don't like to wear pantyhose because I don't like the compression around my midsection.  However, I had a wedding to go to and it was cool enough that I didn't want bare legs.  I had a long skirt, but I wanted stockings longer than knee-highs just to be on the safe side.  So I figured I would try these.

These fit me pretty well.  I am right in that height/weight combination where I can wear either A or B sized pantyhose, and I'm a size 8 or medium in most US-sized pants and skirts.  They had a slight reinforced toe, which I appreciate, as I tend to get runs in pantyhose/stockings/etc.

These had no holes or runs in them and I did not damage them when I put them on.  This is a big plus since I tend to ruin a lot of garments of this type.  These seemed particularly sturdy to me.  They stayed up.  The silicone part is inside the lace at the top and it is clear so it will not show, even if you intend for the tops of these to show (I'm hiding mine well under my skirt, but the option is there for you if you want it).

There were a few loose threads at the top but they weren't terribly noticeable.  In the end, because these fit and seemed really sturdy, I'm quite happy with them.  You can be practical with them if you want, too, if your skirt is long enough, or you can show off the tops for a different look.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"I ordered this ""new"" watch and received a used watch with no face protector and already running its battery. I contacted Amazon customer service and they shipped me another one. Second watch was in same condition so I returned the watches and asked for a full refund."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"3X is really long, but I suppose if the shirt needs to go ""around"" a large centered body some of that would shorten up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I read that they ran small so I ordered a large because I like lots of room. Glad I did! I'm 5'7"" and 140lb and I had the length and roominess I wanted. They fit as I expected after combing through tons of reviews, but I'd definitely recommend buying a size up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"these shoes are super comfortable.  I have purchased 3 pairs of these in the last year or so....problem is that they just don't hold up for a longer period of time.  Even the laces show signs of wear after only a few weeks.

the comfort and price make up for these small shortcomings.  Will purchase again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Fits better than expected! It doesn't smoosh anywhere and it's comfortable all day which is great since my job is very physical. There's no popping out of this one and it's great that it's available in odd sizes like 32G.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.  But it was aggravating to have to return the 11's which I bought based on some other completely unthorough reviews."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Nice item for the price, but way too small. I ordered 12 month size which will just fit in right to my 5 month old."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Will definitely order these again they are a great price and fit perfectly.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My friend just love this, and it was a good price very well made I must say :)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I wear an 8-1/2 shoe so I ordered size 9 (U.S.) in these and they are narrow across the foot and in the calf area. I can barely get them on over thick socks or any type of pants leg. The heel is clear, and I don't like the look. I just bought them for out in the yard. They will do for that, but I would not wear them out in public."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Love this bracelet,but was a little loose on last snap. Cut the excess off because it stuck out. Can tell it will look better the more I wear it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I never had this type of shoes. I do have GORun, hiking boot, trail running shoes, running shoes, court shoes.  I found this great when I ride mountain bike around the park, doing morning yoga exercise. This has become my go-to shoes for a quick workout in the park."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Nothing special. The material and the prints are very average. They are comfy. They run small, it feels to me as if they had cut up one size and then stiched an elastic band of a smaller size."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

Overall i am very happy with this purchase. met all expectations."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Just received them today. Fit as expected and are fairly comfortable.
There was two weeks between order an arrival, which is pretty bad.

Will update review after wearing for awhile."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"The lock is a cable lock, which is nice and thin yet strong, and fits perfectly through the built in zipper locks on many bags.

It's easy to set the combination, and you can change it daily if you wish.  The locking mechanism is actually quite simple, play with it a bit and you'll get the hang of it.  I just push in a little then slide it back and out."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"LOVE LOVE LOVE-  Was looking for the perfect bag to go clubbing.  This is adorable, dark, and a backpack...  What more could you ask???"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I know pretty is a weird word to use for men's pajama pants but... the coloring really is just that. Such a nice color scheme and the colors pop and are really vibrant. I bought it as a gift for my brother and he loves them, and they also fit him perfectly."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Was pleased with the quality. I gave as a gift and the recipient was pleased also!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I love PattyBoutik but I am on the fence on this one. I usually wear a S or M in most brands of shirts and for this shirt the small for this top fit perfect on me. I am 5'3"" at around 145lbs. I wanted something to cover my tummy area, but I'm torn because on one hand it fits great but on the other I worry it's too puffy looking in the front. My biggest fear though is with this color that sweat will easily show so I haven't worn it to photograph any hot weather weddings, which is why I bought it. The other thing is I feel like I need to tan with this color. It blends in with my skin tone so much that it looks nude on me and I'm so pail that I wish I got a different color. So all in all I may just wear this one around the house. BUT that has nothing to do with the product itself!  This fabric of this shirt feels so soft on the skin and washes nicely. I got it right away, shipping is fast and reliable. Wrapped up nicely makes you feel like it's a present! :) Will be buying more in the future regardless and other styles. Thank you once again for a great style PattyB!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Great training shoe. Light, airy, fun to use because of the disc. My second Puma disc shoes. My first one broke after several years of use, the disc system worked perfectly past the life of the shoe."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Came quickly and its has no arch in the shoe so it perfect for me. got 13 EE a little narrow but over all awesome I wear them all day with no pain. also I have had these shoes for 6 months now wearing them as a my everything shoe work, fishing, hiking shopping with the wife and they are still holding up!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I now have four out of the five colors these pants come in, and I'll buy the fifth (white) during the next sale.  Just great pants.  I have a dozen and a half linen garments - shirts, T's, pants, shorts - and these are my favorites.  Great material, great cut, and I even like this color.  I'd read a contrary review on the darker of the tan shades, but this is nicer than the lighter of the two browns.  I wish they came in even more colors; I'd buy them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"does for me what I expected
plenty of room carry daily
perfect quality"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Great pair of shoes! My 2 year old has very wide feet, and the 8W fit perfectly."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"i wanted these to work but the wide size was still not wide enough and the strap that goes around your heal is way too long. the sole of the sandal is incredibly comfortable and i love that it is completely black, but the sandal is so loose it falls right off."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These are really cute and the color combinations are great. I can't wait till it gets colder out so I can wear them. They are a little more bulky than plain cotton socks.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Love these.  I used them for a project for my granddaughter.  Since they were not expensive, they allowed lots of room for learning and/or mistakes.  She painted 5 of them in one afternoon and plans to add more to the scarves this weekend."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These fit great and are very comfortable to wear. The price is also pretty amazing. Time will tell if they hold up and I will update accordingly.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Like my new watch, looking for a Watch with Roman numerals, the strap is very soft. The only thing The hands don't glow in the dark, but for the price would recommend."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Looks like jeans, stretches like sweatpants. Comfy! 32x32 fits as expected... For skinny jeans."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Great product at a great price. I just ordered the wrong size.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"The bag is exactly as the photo shows. It is enough to hold a few items for swimming (not the towel) as a backpack or for school (not too many items). It is nice but a little overpriced in my opinion, but being Adidas, it is to be expected."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,Does not have the support I thought it would have.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I normally wear a 36D, and depending on the bra I'm wearing I sometimes get a little bulge in the cleavage area. But if I go up to DD, the cups are too big.

These fit perfectly! They give me a nice natural shape, no bulge anywhere and super comfortable. I love them.

I have 2 of these, and I got them at Walmart for about $12 apiece. At the time I am writing this review, they are available on Walmart's website."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,My mother-in-law loved this when we got it for her as a gift!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Started using these at 12 months with my girl who is petite and still using them. A good purchase.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These are great, cheap sunglasses for cycling. They fit well with good wrap-around coverage. Rubber grips on the earpieces keep them firmly in place whether on my head or stuck into my helmet. The fact that they are so cheap means I don't care if they get damaged or lost (so far not yet!)."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"For the price this watch was great. It appears more expensive than it is. its a great looking sporty watch specially with the perforated band and yellow edges give a nice touch.  It has decent weight and feel. I would definitely purchase again.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because it did not feel as heavy and solid as some of my other watches, other than that it is a great addition."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love this jacket. And the seller had it to me 4 days sooner than the delivery date.  However I always read the comments and many said that this North Face Jacket ran small. Well it does not, for me anyway. Wish I had ordered the Small. The Medium is too large, the sleeves are too long, and it's sloppy looking. Now I'll have to pay to return. I am 5'4 115 lbs and wear a size 4. Just so others will know what to order."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I bought this as a gift.  She will surely know it's a gag gift.  It looks incredibly cheap.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've had my eye on this beauty for a long time so when I finally found it at a reasonable price on Amazon I bought it. I have to say I absolutely love this piece. This is my sixth Tissot and has become my favorite. What stands out at first is it's stunning blue face. I can't help but stare at it just to take in all of its nuances. The bracelet has solid end links. It is a very comfortable to wear watch. Though it is a large case diameter, it ""wears"" very nicely. The bracelet is not clunky or heavy and is not cheap either. The chronograph pushers are screw in as is the crown. One thing that has impressed me thus far is its lume. It has a blueish lume that lasts throughout the night. The rotating bezel is solid and ratchets nicely. The sub second complication is also lumed which I find as a nice touch.
So far this chrono-diver has met my expectations and more. A must buy for any watch enthusiast."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,Absolutely so small. I normally wear an XL with no problems but the 3XL in this is too small!  Such a great looking shirt but sizing is TERRIBLE!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"soft, comfy, well made and true to size (6-9mo). My daughter is very small for her age (1yr) and this fit perfectly for her birthday party!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I'm giving 5 stars simply due to years of enjoying Converse All-Stars.  However, getting the size right these days is a bit of a hassle.  The Converse website instructs one to select a one-half size smaller shoe than you normally wear.  In my case, I purchased the 7.5 as I generally wear an 8.  Still turned out to be a tad too long.  I had to return for a size 7.  Yet, one my high-tops the 7.5 works fine.  Just be aware you might have to do a little trial and error to get it right.  Other than that, still love my Converses."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Exceeded expectations.  Quality & workmanship very good. Perfect size for my tablet & other items.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I like these shorts a lot! very nice and fit well. not too short and not too long
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,Zipper hard to use.  Inside material would tangle.  I do not recommend this bag.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These are the best baby hats - we have one in every size and my second child has gone through most of them now as well.  They're still good as new and hold up well to washing.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My son got so many compliments on Halloween for his costume! Creeped out even a few adults :)  It was hard to keep the mesh part up to cover the ""neck"", so I used some safety pins to attach the mesh to the plastic neck and that solved that issue!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This shirt was exactly as described and the material feels fantastic.  It has held up great in the wash also.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,If you are reading this review you probably already own a pair of Chucks. I love the look and feel of the Lo Top ones. They look great and feel great.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"My boots lasted about 4 months before the rubber heel sole on one of the boots started to peel off. The sole remained intact but loose for another 2 months before completely pulling off. Otherwise very good boot, sometimes the laces fall out of place because the metal lace keepers bend outward when trying to pull them tight."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I should have ordered them a half size smaller. This happens to me a lot with shoes, so no big surprise. Otherwise, they look and feel great."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"These gloves fit ok,  but you get what you pay for. The finger tips of the right hand had these weird wads of fabric where they rolled it up to seam it or something. They are raveling a bit and I will have to return them.

Ladies, spend a few more bucks and buy a better set of gloves. These are very poorly made."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,too small for the age indicated though the boy was less than the age
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These are super cute, very comfortable and warm. I don't like to wear them barefoot as I can feel the seams, but with a pair of socks they are just right. Fun slippers, well crafted. I've gotten compliments from friends and family."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Wore these socks while hiking the Long Trail in VT. They were very comfortable and stay kept my feet toasty, even while wet. Only complaint is that they take a long time to dry (even on the outside of pack in direct sun light)."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I looked high and low for a purple 'Soft Kitty' t-shirt. Thank you Amazon for having one!  The fabric is light for the summers, I work outdoors and this item is not too hot when worn in the humid southern heat.  Fits exactly as I expected. Priced right, delivered on time as promised."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"It's a beautiful cover up. The only issue is that most cover-ups freely hang in the front to cover you up.... This one kind of pulls to the back back. It's like it won't cover up your frontside at all unless you tie a sash around you. Other than that, it's beautiful and I still wear it at the beach, I just don't really use it to cover my frontside up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I ordered this Jewelry box as a Christmas present and I am very happy with the quality of the case.  It holds about 45 pairs of earrings. The case is very nicely crafted in cream colored leather with attention to detail from the padded top to the gently gathered rounded corners. The inside is a very light pink color. The upper removable tray dividers can be taken out so that it could hold necklaces.  The case was packaged inside fabric type sleeve and the clasp of the jewelry case was wrapped in tissue paper for protection. The case was put into another decorative box which in turn was tightly encased in the shipping box.  This was an excellent purchase as a very good price point.  It makes for a very nice gift.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,The wig and beard look AMAZING... the only thing is that the beard elastic to hold it in place is really big. My husbands head is on the larger size (most hats don't fit him) and the beard was still super loose. He couldn't talk or move his mouth without it slipping or shifting. I suggest trying this on in time to have someone sew or adjust the straps if needed. All in all they looked great.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,This bracelet is very pretty and shiny.  It seems awfully light and fragile.  I expected it to be a little heavier and more substantial.  It is to be a gift and I will be happy to give it and hope that the recipient gets a lot of wear and enjoyment out of it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I love these boots so much!!! I bought them for a Halloween costume and I wear them everyday!!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Grandson loves them. He's really into fire trucks. He wore them for Christmas morning.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I have a black pair of these shoes, same shoes. They are size 81/2 Wide which is what I ordered in this shoe. But these white ones are much shorter probably 1/4 - 1/2"" shorter in the toes. So my toes are a little cramped. The bad thing about it was that I had already worn them out and about in town before I realized that they were so much smaller so I didn't really feel comfortable sending them back after wearing them for 4 or 5 hours. I  sure wish that I could have swapped them for a 9 wide but it is too late now because I have tried to tough it out and wear them anyway this week. But I will know next time to make sure that the shoe fits very well when I first put them on. I had a stroke 13 years ago and these are the only style shoe that I can wear now. Since they slide on and off so easily they are a great shoe for me to wear! I absolutely love these shoes!!!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Super cute, made well, fits great!

My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs.
I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.

My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.

I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.

The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom.
The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up.
The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.

We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back).
The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.

I returned the size 2T, which also could have worked nicely, they were not too big and she may have grown into them, but I liked the fit of the 18 month suit a little better."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This scarf was so cute in person, so happy I bought it not to mention the price is great! Super fast shipping and would no doubt buy again!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I ordered this sport bra for running, because I did not feel comfortable enough with the regular bra. It is good, but not excellent - in my opinion it lacks in comfort. I can feel it the entire time I am wearing it, it sqeezes to much and the feeling is not good. The good thing is that the straps can easily be adjusted, but the problem is that they only use plastick stick which can easily be worn out. As I said it is a good bra, but not excellent one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,I bought a large and it fits a little tighter than I expected.  Not as loose as the picture on the model.  I guess if I'm swimming in it that will actually be a good thing.  Haven't had it in the water yet.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I like the shoes. Most of my shoes are a size 8, but this was uncomfortable. Fit me more like a 7 1/2 would. Quality was very good, however."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"As an individual who has dealt with a small cup size all my life, I am used to disappointment when purchasing bras. Even more so now that I have gained weight, and can't even find my size in a store. So, despite the glowing reviews of this bra, I was prepared for yet another bra with puckered, too-large cups, and an uncomfortable band. Surprise! It fits and is extremely comfortable. Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"would reccomend, the item seemed small when I first saw it, but in reality I was very pleased it was spacous."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Fits OK, may be well made but I'll never know.  The dye or something apparently emits a rather unpleasant odor.  Thought it might have been me.  Switched back to my normal shoes and it disappeared. I could not stand it and I certainly would not want anyone to think that *I* smelled like that.  Gave them to Goodwill."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,my son love it look awesome  fast service great seller
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,It's ok but doesn't let the nipples show well. They look like missiles.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"My only complaint is that they seem to run a little large, especially the length.  For jeans that are supposed to fit below the waist, they end up being a few inches too long."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"This is my third pair of Dickies brand work pants. Two of the three pairs - in different styles, have similar problems.

I'm about 5'7"", 125 lbs and the size 4 is the right size for me. Unfortunately, in Dickies' carpenter style, the waist is higher and wider than their cargo workpant style. I have wide hips and a small waist, so after purchasing a pair of the cargo pants and liking the style and fit, I was disappointed when I tried these on. These pants ride higher and looser in the waist than other Dickies.

Other reviewers have stated how rugged the material is. I would add the caveat that it's rugged--by Women's clothing standards. This isn't fashion attire, but it isn't the heavy duck cloth typical in many Men's work pants, either. I can't speak to the working conditions of other people, but I work in a factory alongside men and the work I perform puts the same strains on my clothes - it would be nice if my clothes could last as long. These pants are new, so we'll see.

These pants had frayed seams right out of the bag. I examined the seams closely, and it appears to be cosmetic (the fringe of the under-layer of fabric didn't lay quite right when the crotch seams were stitched) - not structural. As this is the second pair I've gotten with seam problems, I'd say Dickies has a quality control problem.

Pros:
Good quality materials
Good length and style
Rear pockets big enough for my wallet

Cons:
Material could be more rugged

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Nice top if you can fit into it. I usually  buy 1x, bought  3x. Wish I bought 5x for a nice loose fit. Can just get into it. Was cheap enough to keep it and hope for weight loss"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I bout these for my one year old who wears a 6.5. And these were tooooo big . He likes to wear them around the house though. Hopefully he can fit them before it warms up .
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This Tommy Hilfiger floral hardcore carry on is beautiful! I love the colors and the design. It is very easy to use,the wheels are excellent and makes for a very agile suitcase. It is very comfortable to use. The interior is also very nice. I used it on a recent trip and had no issues with it. I love it !!! It is made well and seems sturdy. I would highly recommend it !"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Needed a pair of jeans as I've put on some weight and have tons of jeans just sitting in my closet.  As I'm working on losing the extra pounds, can't walk around without bottoms so, looked for some reasonable priced jeans and these fit the bill.  Had enough stretch without bagging.  The length was perfect as I'm not short nor too tall, but sometimes have an issue with the length being too short for regular.  It held up very well to washing and was a bit tight on the first wear, but loosened up very quick.  The are flattering and very easy to move in."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Love this watch. I've got several of their AMW320 and also AMW330 series, and I'm very pleased with all of them. This also comes in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both.

I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sports but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses.
Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.

This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious.
I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great.
The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.

I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.

There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these all really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it).
I found mine for around $30 shipped. Prices fluctuate, so do shop around."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"EXCELLENT WATCH, I USE IT EVERY DAY, NICE LOOKS, STRONGLY RECOMENDED BY THE WAY, I HAVE FIVE OF THEM WITH DIFFERENT COLORS"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking for something simple and not too expensive.  These fit the bill just fine. They are light but not too flimsy, just right for fresh out of the shower. I really like scuffs because they are so easy to walk in and out of at the bedside, and maybe out to the mailbox. I wouldn't mow the lawn in them, but hey, they are great for around the house."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Love the look of the shoe, and had high hopes that they would work for me, but I need a wide toe area and a narrower heel.  These were much to wide overall.  If I could wear a normal width in the toe area, I would have kept them.  Unfortunately I had to return this pair of shoes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Gorgeous, sexy dress, I receive so many compliments when I wear this dress!!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is an absolutely gorgeous pin! It's so eye-catching. I just love it!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Its really a top quality watch winder. Its more than what I had expected. Good build, and so far so good. Although I started using it in less than one month but it work well. No noise and work well.

Hopefully it continue to work well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I received this belt and I had to return it right away. The Seller did not object, and kindly offered to pay for shipping costs involved. NOTHING was wrong or objectionable with the belt, but despite my efforts to compare my shoes which I placed next to three different computer screens, the color did not match the pair of shoes that I wanted this belt to match.

The reason for this review is because of an issue that I consider of great importance. It is about the Buckle.

Other Sellers offer Ratchet Belts with not only an exceedingly heavy buckle but their buckles have a visible layer of paint. An unacceptable condition occurs when ~in the restroom~ one pulls slacks down. The heavy buckle will drag on the floor, and after several trips to the restroom, approximately half of the painted area has no paint any more. It looks ugly !

This Seller offers the exact same belts with a reliable Ratchet Mechanism and very nice looking leather; but...

Difference #1: the buckle accurately replicate the appealing look of a conventional buckle used for centuries.
Difference #2: there is no paint to scratch.
Difference #3: the buckle is lighter.

BOTTOM LINE - If you guys out there do not want to invest some good money in a belt that everyone notices it is all scratched out and looks ugly just days after you start wearing it, then, this Seller's has resolved that issue brilliantly.

I thought that you wanted to know."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Really sharp watch - works well for more dressy or casual events - I needed a watch with a very light brown or camel colored band to match belts and shoes I wear and this one does the trick - Timex usually has served me well so I am sure this one will be no different!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"Product is at least one size smaller than stated, if not more, will update if they break in well. But as for now I'm going to try to get feeling back in my big toe. made for a poor shift. Even a short one (5 hours)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Seem pretty good, but I haven't really worn them for a couple hours at a time. I had return my 1st pair and get a bigger size & these were a little tight, but after a few wears they are about perfect."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,amazing! I love it! looks adorable on my navy blue bag!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Just did not meet my needs, did not seem to suit my feet and were uncomfortable; I returned them.  They may work well for other people."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Wrangler jeans are the best. Great fit and price!! Cheers!!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I did not expect much from this (having ordered from Patty Boutique before via eBay - it was hit or miss, and delivery always took forever). I only ordered because I'd get it within 2 days under Prime and could return it if anything went wrong.
The dress does not look like much when taken out of the plastic bag - the Navy Blue seems somewhat dull, and the fabric is soft cotton jersey, somewhat thin.
But boy, does it transform when put on! The pattern is really flattering and is really smart - though made in China, it is made for larger-boned European women and is very flattering. Here's what worked on my 5.4, 165-lb, slightly pregnant (and suddenly size 12 instead of 8) frame:
- Shoulders fit just right - nothing cuts into armpits, nothing falls off - sleeves start where they are supposed to start
- Sleeves themselves are of decent length - not too short, they run to mid-palm and can be pulled up slightly
- Neck line is beautiful - it drapes nicely on the chest, and would work for small or big-busted
- Length is great - hits right below the knee (and will probably hike up just a bit as belly grows)
- Ruched pattern in the front and in the back creates slim silhouette and has plenty of fabric to expand as pregnancy progresses
- Unless it fades or shrinks in laundry, I see myself wearing this dress when not pregnant - it would look nice on a curvy figure.

I think I will get it in a couple other colors, as it seems to be able to take me through summer and upcoming Fall.
If I accessorize right (tights or no tights, necklaces or shawls, shoes or boots) - it would work for the office and for going out."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,shipped and delivered before I expected.  The color and size were right on.  The comfort of the shoe is unbelievable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"I've purchased many washes of this size and cut, and I find that every pair fits me a little bit differently. This particular wash (""cast shadows"") is much looser than other washes I own, and they stretch out more throughout the day. (These jeans in ""soft black"" are my favorites."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've now had this bag for 4 years, and used it daily.  I might replace it, but not because anything is broken, because it's scuffed up and it looks like the leather could fail, it looks 85% as good as new.  For what was an $80 bag it's done remarkably well.  Samsonite did a great job with the stitching and hardware that hold this bag together."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is great it's light weight it's still to be put to the test on our Cancun trip coming up. I think it will do great on my 10 year old. Love the chin strap hopefully it holds up while on the boat
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love these slippers. I wear a 6 1/2 and I ordered a med, they fit great!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have foot problems, so it is hard to find shoes that I can wear all day.  After being on a treadmill for an hour, I put these on for the rest of the day and went shopping, and was on my feet all day with the Grandkids, my feet never bothered me.  This is what I was expecting since I wear a different style of Haflinger as a house shoe and have never had problems.  I wear Chaco in the summer, but start to have problems when winter comes and I have to start wearing real shoes.  I have spent a lot of money on good brands and still have problems, so I am delighted that Haflinger has shoes I can wear outside the house.  I am a little worried about getting them wet, but I guess I'll deal with that when the time comes.  I will probably be buying another pair for outdoors again soon.  Best shoe I have found for all around comfort and support!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Great looking & comfortable socks. The color is more khaki than a bright white.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,This is a very cute hat. It did fit on my 3 year old but it was tight and she would not wear it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Seems fitted for Asian physiques.  If proportions are correct for arm length and shoulders, chest is too tight.  Torso length is also short.  Otherwise I like the jacket."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These arrived on time and surpassed my expectations.  They are beautiful and loved by the three people that received them as gifts.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Nice jacket but I had to return it since it was incredibly small for a 2X (I suspect it was mislabeled in manufacturing).
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Perfect! The best panties I've  worn in a long time. Comfy and just enough lite control that you want. I'll be back for more!!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Terrific slacks at a phenomenal price.  He tried various Haggar slacks on in a local department store and knew the exact waist and inseam size to order.  We were actually a bit worried because the price was so good.  But...low and behold!  Fabulous fit and terrific quality at a perfect price.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Fast shipping! Very cute summer dress , belt gives it a nice touch !"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"WARNING: These will shrink if you wash and dry normal.  I have other cotton tops by other manufacturers also made with all cotton that do not shrink.  But this top will- I would recommened buying TWO sizes up to account for shrinkage.  I had to give them away because after drying they no longer fit in the armholes- too tight.  Also, I did not care for the seam running down the back- I wish they would make it with a side seam instead."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,First pair of Crocs I have ever owned. And I must say that I really like them. Love how the little nubbs on the sole make me feet feel. Like getting a little foot massage everytime I wear them. Just passing this info on. Really like the shoes.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"My daughter wanted a Christmasy sweatshirt and LOVED this one.  They do run small, she's about a size 4 so it fit her fine but if you like things loose fitting or you aren't slight, you'll want a bigger size."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is so cute! It's perfect for my daughter's first birthday party!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,The top is cute and fits perfectly! However the shorts are way too big!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Fast delivery! Item was not expected to be here for two more days but it came in today!

It's only my first day wearing it and I like it a lot! I wore it under jeans for a majority of the day and my butt looks AMAZING!!! Now I tried it with leggings and it doesn't look bad but just not as good. You could see the lining of the undergarment. I'm gonna try it with my other leggings, pants and dresses and see how it goes. But I would definitely recommend this item!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"PROS:
- Lots of colors and patterns
- Speedy delivery
- Flexible
- Didn't shrink when I sanitized them
- All 20 were there

CONS:
- There were 3 pot leaf designs (all different colors) and I don't smoke pot. So. Yeah. lol
- I got one set of duplicates
- Really easy to get the balls off. They may fall off when used."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Bought this for my 7 year old for a trip to Disneyland in March, fits perfect and is super cute."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Wife hasn't complained yet so it must work. Priced right because she is the word frugal.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,The length of the arms and legs were a little shorter than I expected a 6x to fit.  But nice quality and great value.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"It took several different sandals to find the perfect one for our trip later this year to southern Italy (as in, hot!). But these are the ones. As others have said, it's incredibly adjustable, and that is a major plus.  I was looking for a leather sole as I think that's more comfortable when doing a lot of walking, especially when it's hot.  This sole has great support (I think I have a medium arch).  The strap design works well and is really attractive. I LOVE the ""Vintage Silver"" color - it's actually a mix of subtle silver/gold/bronze shades, and has some sheen but in a rich way. Should go well with daytime vacation clothes while being OK with slightly dressier evening travel wear-"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love this top so comfortable and washes well.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love this jacket! However, it does run large.  I am normally 16-18, so ordered 2X.  The sleeves are too long, shoulder seams sag and lots of room around the torso.  It is very comfortable, and I would return it and buy a smaller size, but I purchased as a lightning deal during Cyber Monday week, so it costs more now.  I completely did NOT follow the care instructions and washed in warm water, dried in the dryer in an attempt to shrink it and it did not shrink or fade!  AGH!  But - It is so comfy that I will cuff the sleeves and wear around the house, while keeping an eye out for these to go on sale sometime.  If it was the right size, this would be my very favorite jacket."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,The shoes are great.  They run a little (half size large).
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Just beautiful. Nice, large scarf gives lots of styling options. Also got one to give as a gift."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Great sweaters I own 10 now. Fun way to switch up outfit.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I ordered these Sketchers in a size 11.5 3E - as listed on the Amazon site. They arrived as 11.5 wide. Now ""wide"" is generally considered to be 2E, so they sent the wrong width. Fortunately for me they seem to fit despite the width incongruity, but watch out. The fit and finish of this HD sneaker is good, which is why I'm not returning them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Ordered large.  Received a medium.  Shirt is not as long as portrayed in pic.  I am 5'6"" and want to wear with leggings.  Don't think I would be able to pull it off."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This item was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly. It's beautiful. Very happy with my order.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These are super flattering jeans. I'm a solid size 10 and these shape me perfectly, would recommend"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered this cape for myself for my birthday and it is amazing, I love it! I saw a similar one at Macy's that was twice the price and I am so glad I waited for this one to arrive instead, it looks even better than it does online. I ordered a large but the seller sent a medium (prob because sold out of large?) and it fits perfectly. I was a little unsure about the sizing based on the chart but I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium fits me fine. The fleece is high quality and slightly stiff, it feels almost like a wool. The stiffness will help the cape keep it's shape over time. And the collar comes up slightly in the back of the next which gives it a little flair and elegance, especially when your hair is pinned up! It is very high quality and the arm holes are in exactly the right place and provide a good range of movement. The snaps on the front are very sturdy and hidden when the cape is completely closed, no buttons or zips to ruin the sleek, simple style. I can throw this on with jeans and equestrian boots for a day out running errands, or cocktail attire for an evening out...this is definitely a piece that should be added to every wardrobe."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Super soft and comfortable, pockets are extremely small you can't really use them for much. These are great for sleeping in or hitting the gym."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Only had them a week or so, but so far so good.  They fit well, and with me being  cabinet maker, customers love the wooden arms."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Run small. Buy a size larger. Great buy.......Fantastic comfort. I bought 3 packs, 9 pair. I will buy these forever, if you keep stocking them. I am so hooked on these boxer briefs. It was one of my best buys of 2014. I now have 9 pair, and if had the extra cash. I would buy 9 more pair. I took a chance on these & struck gold..... I am not one to get attached to my underwear, but these are the most comfortable I have owned in all my 63 yrs. of life. If I can, I will replace all my underwear with these. I should have bought more. They fit perfect in the pouch, and the comfort is top shelf for the money. Go ahead, go out and spend $20.00 a pair for underwear. I think that is rediculous  for underwear. After you wash them, they fit even better. Cannot be beaten for the money. Like I said, go a size larger. My extra large are perfect. I am 6'1"" & 210 lbs.

I cannot understand why their are any negative view points on this product. I too, took a chance on these Boxer Briefs, and like I said, I have 9 pair!. These could possibly sell much higher. Like I said earlier, this has to be my most surprising purchase of 2014. Buy one size larger, and I think you will as surprised as me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is a really nice....the pendant has some weight to it which I really like and the chain is strong and longer than usual. It was purchased as a substitute for the real thing because I do not wear or take real jewelry pieces with me when I travel.  Received numerous compliments and am finding this is my new FAVORITE.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Received ring today.  The workmanship is great.  Good looking ring.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I like themI like them a lot and tend to just buy this brand as I get what I expected. Very comfortable even after they have been washed many times. Do shrink a bit, but I am tracking with that.  a lot and tend to just buy this brand as I get what I expected."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These are gorgeous rings, a definite bargain for the price.  I ordered them for a silent auction for a fundraiser for the National MS Society & they were a hit. I hated to let them go. I am purchasing another set for myself."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Wow! These shoes are great. The fact that they are covered in sequence was a bonus. I didn't realize that till I got them.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,The colors of this scarf are beautiful. I love it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Hard to tell how long it will hold up, but at this price it was still a bargain.  Would purchase again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these in size 10.5 wide.  I normally wear size 11 wide sneakers, but these are a touch big.  No big deal.

They look very sharp!  I wear them with or without socks, with pants, with jeans, with shorts.  I live in NYC and walk everywhere, and these shoes are just so comfortable.

I have flat feet, so I can't wear shoes which have a pronounced hump in the insole.  The insole of these shoes is nice and flat, which I love, but you may not like that.

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.  However, I'm finding those rough edges are smoothing out the more I wear the shoes, so we'll see!

UPDATE: The inside seams of the shoes really smoothed out after two weeks of wear (I wore short socks for the first two weeks). Now, the shoes are very comfy without socks as well!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These are perfect for my 2month old. Still a little big but room for him to grow. (6month ones). They don't ever fall off like socks. I'd ordered some for my SIL as a baby shower gift!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Very nice purse.  Got it for my daughter for Christmas.  She loved it, and really liked the color.  It's prettier in person."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I love Merrel's.  I just will I could buy more
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,My husband loves these. They are comfortable and really nice.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"It's not a pretty looking shoe, but they are VERY comfortable. Great for long walks. I bought them for my trip to NY city. I'm so in love with this shoes that I bought another pair."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,Sizing is very different I would caution anyone buying this product. Shipping is expensive so you're stuck with what you get I got a size larger then what was recommended bc I wanted it a little larger not form fitting and still it is much to small doesn't even button waste of money
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,I gave this 4 not 5 stars just because it is a bit rough looking. It is beautiful and I would have given in 4.5 stars if I could. It is beautiful and I get tons of compliments but it is a bit (cant find the word.......) It is a nice quality nice design but looks handmade. Not sure if that is the word because it does not look cheap but I hope you get my point.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"i ordered white toms,i received natural canvas khaki color-it is not the same!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Seems like it's getting harder to find shirts outside the ""standard"" colors, but I happen to like them. This particular shirt is just gorgeous. The pinstriping is subtle, but attractive. The fit is spot on. After trying out this shirt, it was a no-brainer to go back and order it in a second color."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Scarf is very soft and looks nice.  The color is more of an off white.  The butterflies are a little larger than I thought they would be from the picture but still very pretty.  I purchased this as a gift for Christmas so can't evaluate on how it drapes, washes, etc. which is why I only gave four stars."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Super cute luggage for a weekend or overnight! Was not expecting this to be as nice but as described and delivered as promised! Purchased for a teen for those weekend trips! the smaller bag is larger than I expected and very roomy! Well worth the price! Very pleased! would buy again!!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Great, thought it was much better than some of the reviews.  I would absolutely purchase again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I wanted a compact rain shell for traveling; it is better to pack layers instead of carrying a big coat. This rain jacket is impenetrable to water when I run a sleeve under water, and it is completely dry afterwards. I have not used it in the rain yet.

I bought the jacket ""big"" so it could be a shell and I could layer underneath it (with a packable down coat, fleece, and/or hoodie). On its own, the jacket looks comfortable and cut nicely, but not big. I am 5'6"" 105 lbs and bought size medium for growing room (I like jackets loose anyway), but it already looks great as it is.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink. I'm not picky about my pinks though, so I'll wear it. This color would be cheerful on a wet day, but it will stand out in a crowd.

I look forward to using this jacket a lot in the future!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Got these as a requirement as a part of my bridesmaid outfit (worn with long black chiffon dress).  Looked SO cute, and very comfy!  Chucks are a classic for a reason."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My friend hasn't worn this one yet, so I can't give it an honest review, but he loved the white one. I will assumed he loves this one as well!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"love the color and style of these shoes, I just wish I could wear them longer but I find my feet hurt from the lack of support  after wearing them for a little while (I find the same with all of the chuck taylor styles, sadly!). These are bright and fun and fit well - I am a size 41 and bought the size 10 and it fit right, normally I am a US 11 but the 10 worked for this style."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These are very comfy shoes! I usually wear a 10 and bought a 10 in these and they fit perfectly.  I have medium wide feet and they are roomy and comfortable. The goga mat insole is what makes this shoe I think. It has a really nice rubbery bounce feel under my feet. I have been having problems with my feet hurting from not enough cushion in my old running shoes and these have been a really nice change with my feet not hurting after my walks ( I walk about 5-6 miles a day on gravel trails, and the gravel usually pokes up into the bottom of my shoes and bruises my feet but these protected me pretty good).  I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides. These looked better in person than I thought and the mesh look is different looking in person (it seems like it's more of a fabric texture and less of a large mesh material than it looks like in the picture, although they seem breathable enough, they don't have large mesh holes like I originally pictured). I'm still not in love with the way these look, but they are good for taking out on the trails, and it's kind of nice to have a new pair of shoes I don't mind getting dirty (instead of the pretty kind of new shoes that I really only want to save for the gym and places they won't get messed up :)
Overall, definitely happy with these runners."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Promptly delivers, no qualms about anything else.

Great boot, I wear it all the time now.

It works for the office environment and I can use it as casual wear."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,7 year old daughter loved it and it fit wonderfully!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,ordered my regular size and they fit fine.  Great look and very comfortable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Quite beautiful! I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch. Public education has not failed us completely."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,Its cute but it was very small upon arrival and after washing shrank teeny tiny.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Ordered a size up and it fit great.  Good stretch.  Holding up so far in the wash.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Very light, don't even feel them. They didn't come with any backs, although they do stay in place pretty well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"They are so stretchy that i can only wear them one day, and at the end of the day they are baggy and falling down..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Great novelty shirt! Im expecting to get plenty of laughs from it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This is an AMAZING DRESS!!!  Got it in the navy and gold/brown.  I am size 35"" bust/29.5"" waist/37.5"" hips and got the Large since it was a junior dress and I am a Misses (I am generally a medium in Misses) and it fit good in the hips and waist but a little loose in the bust/shoulder area- I am 5'6""/135lbs.  The dress length comes to exactly where is shows on the model in this listing.  The colors are vey nice and because it is a bandage dress- it give the body a nice ""hug"" showing off all your curves! --However, in the size large the dress is appropriate for work or office place as it was not too snug like a bandage dress usually is-it has a sophistication to it.  Dress is very comfortable and made well!  High quality!  I did end of exchanging the dress for a medium to get a more snug fit as I like a really contoured look.  The fit was great!  I LOVE it so much I am going to buy it in the other color (Mint) listed as well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I'm wearing now. I have a lot of different color and style underwear and tidy whites fit right in. My girlfriend says it reminds her of her 1st  real boyfriend and I'm 70.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I ordered my usual size, but will need to return them and get the next larger. I do like the fabric and support they provide as well as the fly."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Gorgeous dress! I LOVE the sequins and the fit.  It was delivered really quickly.  I ordered it in ""gold"" which is more of a rose gold, but it's stunning.  And I liked it so well that I've ordered another one in green."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,My Danske clogs are a 41 and loose fitting. The 41 in these Sophie shoes make my toes and heel fit the very edge.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

I've brought it in the shower and into a swimming pool with me and had no problems, so it seems great for water sports and activities."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,love the vest over the onesie. Such a cute outfit.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These are awesome chucks....love the bright classic white. I was a little unsure of the sizing, and after some questions and confusion with back and forth e-mails oing to my in-box and/or spam, I got just what I ordered."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I feel like I spend half the winter searching for boots that are just right.  I end up buying a lot and then returning them because they aren't quite what I am looking for.  These are gorgeous boots!  The suede looks really classy and they feel extremely well made.  They are also really comfortable.  I should note that I purchased the boots a half size larger than my normal size so I could wear thick socks underneath and I am glad that I did.  If I really had to find something to complain about, it would be that they are noisier/clunkier than any of my other boots.  That is a very small price to pay though!  LOVE LOVE LOVE them!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Great, big bag! There is a weird zipper at the bottom of the bag, that unzips the bottom of a larger side pocket. Why?! No clue. Also, the strap needs to be longer! It feels a little too high (I'm 5'7""). I would also like to have an inside zipper pocket in this purse. Other than that, it's great."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Cute, and a nice color with jeans, but I had to send them back. they were way too big in the heel for me, even with heavy socks."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love love love these!! Will be buying more again soon

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,I can't tell if they're comfortable or not because the cup size is too small.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My son love the Punk Rock look, so every design bracelets and rings he have."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Just what my son wanted. This is a good quality jacket. I purchased it a size larger than what my son wears so he can hopefully get two years out of it. We live in a south Alabama and the winters aren't harsh, but this allows rom for layering. He can wear it daily or for hunting which is great.

The jacket comes very stiff, but softened up after washing once. After a few more washed I feel that it will mold even better. It is insulated and fairly thick. It is perfect for low temperatures with layers underneath. The zipper works great and we haven't experienced any issues with this jacket. It looks just like the picture!

My son picked this jacket out himself (he is 12) and I am very pleased with his selection."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Good quality. Seems to be a bit small will order a size larger.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I love the fit and the feel of the fabric. I will order more.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I am a professional  haircolorist and obviously stand on my feet. These are nice looking, lighter weight than you expect and will save your feet .Many of my clients have bought them also and they come in lots of colors.."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Bought two of these for my daughters and they look great in them. The dresses look unique and I had a lot of compliments.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,I love these! They are about 1/2 inch too big. I ordered a women's 8 (my regular size). There wasn't an option for 7.5 so just going to stick with them. The color is a sky blue as shown. I'm going to wear them for my wedding. Sooo cute.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,My favorite pair of summer shoes. I love them so much. I don't want to put anything else on my feet. The yoga mat soles are the best. winning.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold up as well.  I like to wear different rings for different occasions, especially when traveling, so I don't have to worry about losing my actual ring set or having it stolen.

This set is very dainty looking and quite nice.  I ordered a size 7, which is what my original set is, and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable to wear.  I take it off to wash my hands and I wouldn't sleep in it, so I have not seen any discoloration on the metal or on my hands.  For the price that this is offered at, I would definitely recommend it for someone to purchase as an extra set to wear on occasion.

Like most online shoppers, I read through reviews posted by others to determine whether I want to try out a product. I always do what I can to help by describing my purchases honestly. If I have been helpful please check yes, that it was helpful to you and I will do the same for all of the helpful reviews I find! Thank you for reading."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support. ALL OF THIS SAID, your results may vary of course!"

Surprisingly, I've used it for a week on my Rolex Perpetual Oyster and it has been keeping perfect time. It is super quiet and has several different modes you can choose from. It also comes with an attachment for different size watch faces. It looks really nice on my nightstand eventhough it is made of plastic it does have a wood finish look and the clear cover prevents dust and dirt from the outside. Let's hope it'll last in the longrun!

These are true to size and my 3 year old son can easily put these shoes on all by himself thanks to the dual sided velcro. The Velcro is easy to adjust for a looser or tighter fit around the ankle. Im a fan of Under Armour!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Since we can never have enough umbrellas, I was pleased for the chance to try out the TravelZen umbrella in exchange for my review. {I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion. I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}

This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This bag is adorable and even more so in person! It's completely adjustable, has lots of pockets, and seems very high quality. I've had $200 purses that show more wear in a day than this one has shown in a week."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,This dress runs on the small side (I wear a 12 and it was snug in the thigh area). It is also thin. If you have any problem areas then go up a size or two. The dress is adorable and is versitile.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"This swimsuit is adorable! However, I wore it once and won't be wearing it again. I purchased it for a beach vacation and got one days use out of it--however, the color bled and stained my skin underneath the suit. It also rubbed off on my (much more expensive) cover up, and the beach lounge chair I was sitting on.. Additionally, the top is very flimsy and offers no cup support at all. (Unlike how it appears in the picture.) For the price paid I didn't expect much and probably would have given it a higher star rating if it hadn't stained my skin, clothing, and beach chair!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"An excellent shoe. I would strongly recommend getting a half size down. I wear a size 12 and purchased an 11.5. These fit perfectly. At first, they may seem stiff or even a little tight around the width of the toes, this does however subside after one or two wears. After mine broke in, they became one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own. I can wear them all day while standing in the lab and I have very little discomfort. I definitely recommend buying a pair!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"I was looking forward to receiving this robe. I appeared to be what I was looking for (except color). Unfortunately it won't do. The robe tie is woefully too short. It is so small that it just makes one tie and comes undone easily (!), can't have that now, can we? After two washings, it is starting the unraveling at the sleeves. Not much, but it does make me think this will be ratty looking in a year or so. It is lightweight which is nice for Arizona but not the softest material I've experienced. I have just ordered a bathrobe from another company and with hope, it will be what I was looking for.

One year later update:

For the price, this is a poor product. This is a $15 bathrobe that is good for a year of daily, yet light use. The seams are just giving away. There are numerous fabric strands all over the robe. It never was very soft. If I had paid $15, I would've just figured I got what I paid for. Not so with this robe at $40. I guess I'm looking for another robe one year later..."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I got these one size up for my daughter to wear as indoor slippers. They are perfect! We have wood floors and it is starting to get cold so I bought these for her. I wanted her to be able to have some slippers that would stay on her feet (she's almost 2) and that also looked cute. These are perfect because they have a soft sole, which is the best type of shoe for a little walker. She loves wearing them. Even though they are a little big on her, they stay on because of the ankle strap. They are well made, so they will last long, too."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I really like these sneakers.  They  have moderate arch support and a firmly cushioned sole.  They are comfortable right out of the box.  The design is cute in person - bright, but not crazy.  They do run nearly 1/2 size smaller than the newer New Balance sizing, but if you've worn New Balance for years, get your old size and you'll be fine.  I recommend them.

Not much by way of traction or support, but that's not what I'm looking for - I'm looking for something casual and flexible (not literally, but... that too).

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Sizing I kept thinking, I'd hate to order these shoes and not have them fit. I read somewhere between 2030 reviews regarding Comfort and sizing. There were a significant number of complaints regarding the sizing of the shoes. 100% of the complaints were about over sizing issues. I normally wear a size 12 wide. But after reading the reviews and of course checking the sizing chart; I came to the conclusion that I would go with A size 11 1/2 m. With standard shipping (free) The shoes arrived in a timely manner. When I popped the shoes out of the box, I found a beautiful brown soft leather shoe. Now, I would not describe the shoe as a hightops or mids and of course they're not flip-flops. But the glove leather that does fit around your foot is just high enough that one would be only marginally wrong in calling them sandals. When I placed the shoes on my feet the length was perfect but the width was a different story. The width of the shoe on my left foot was dead-bang, whereas the right foot felt like it was in a vise grip. There was absolutely no problem with returning them. Called Amazon immediately and I was provided with a digital return label. Drop them in the mail and my account was credited. My only disappointment was that the shoe simply did not fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"It will be for a present, but look comfortable and ok about the size"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Cute shoes! for the price is worth getting. I do not have narrow feet and the size I ordered fit me well. I always got half a size up. Long wear, depending on the activity, the shoe is comfortable."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Purchased for a friend as a gift ! It's so beautiful I might have to buy myself one ! My friend loves it and said she is constantly complimented on how beautiful it is !
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My boyfriend got a moderately deep scratch in the face of his new favorite watch. He loves the watch so much that he was prepared to buy a new one. I did a little research and found this product on Amazon. He was skeptical but decided the low price was worth giving a shot. Amazingly, the product worked wonderfully. When he saw how well it worked, he used it to remove the scratches from an older watch as well. Both watches are Timex Expedition watches."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,terrible. cheapest of the cheapest and looks like it came from the dollar tree. The advertised picture makes it look nice and firm but its flat and made of a flimsy plastic. did not use it at all
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Really nice, big wallet, a lot of space for everything you need. Good quality. Love it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Got this for my son who will be a ring bearer in a wedding, Fits perfect and so adorable! It runs true to size for an average size 4.
The only con is the shirt is a bit short, but not a deal breaker."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"We are getting ready to travel internationally and this money belt seems to be just what I wanted.  It has enough space for credit cards and foreign money and can be worn safety away from pick pockets under my shirt.  I had it on all day around the house and forgot I had it on, it should work out great when I really need it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I mean is OK. Is not what I was expecting, but is OK. It does the job!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I love these shoes.  I love fashionable shoes but after wearing high heels for the last 25 years and a couple of knee surgeries I can only wear about a 2 inch heel now.  It is  very difficult to find a nice trendy sandal with a 2 inch heel.  This shoe is comfortable too.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I wear an 8. 5 or 9 and a 39 was way too small. The Makenna style seemed to run a bit more narrow than the regular Dansko clogs that I'm use to. In the photo, I really liked the wide strap, but it seemed bulky for me at the ankle and less dressy than I thought they'd be when I tried them on. In the end, I preferred the narrower strap and the width of the clog style Marcella Dansko and chose a 40 rather than a 39. (I have 4 pairs of Danskos which have lasted for 10 years and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,They are too small.  Too bad.  They are very cute.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,The fabric is thin however foot the price it was expected. Loved the look abd can't wait to rock these in Vegas!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Please be aware that this backpack is seriously tiny. It's maybe a foot tall (just slightly taller than my Galaxy 4 phone) and as wide as my phone. This is my mistake since I didn't look at the size when I ordered it.  But it was suprising to see the small amazon box and wonder how they shoved a backpack into it (they didn't...it's little).The comb and mirror included are also itty bitty, but I'm an adult so these are not meant for my giant grown up lady hands.

It's a cute bag, the graphics look crisp, and for the price it's a good deal.

*I bought it for my friend's daughter, who is five. I'll be giving it to her in a few days, and if she likes it/it fits I'll be satisfied

Update: The backpack does indeed fit her, however it's on the loosest setting. She's a skinny little five-year-old, but she's kind of tall. So...I guess take that information as you will. She did like it though, and thought it was cute. I didn't see her use any of the hair things, but she thought the bag was cute and was excited about the hair clips."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Great tap shoe but the regular was too narrow and hurt my daughter's toes. Ordered her wide and they were much better!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

The price of these shoes was outstanding!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"These are okay, but they still slip down my heel.
I let my daughter wear them with her sperry's (she has bigger feet than me) a size 9 women's and she really like them!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"It's a very cute dress but WAY too small. Yes, it is very stretchy & a thicker material, but I wish I got two sizes up instead of one. I'm a curvy size 10/12 and the XL was not big enough."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,thankful for EASY returns on amazon as these were too small!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Would have been 5 stars but fabric is a tad thin and cannot be worn alone.. Needs to be layered or it is see through
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,Looks a little clunky and a bit small I would stick to the regular leather chuck Taylors
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and he loves the quality of material, as well as, the fit of it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,LOOSE fit and kind of heavy. Would be great if you wear them over thermal layers I guess.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I have to agree with the review that said these have a bit of a strange fit.  I think the problem is, that they do not offer much support so feel kind of mushy. The other problem I have with them is that the netting material they use for the background of the shoes look very cheap to me.  That being said, if you are wearing them around the house, they are fine.  But with the mushy fit, I would not recommend them for a walking shoe."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is high quality product. Great fit. Great price as well.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Fits perfectly on me.  I had previously tried that size at a store to confirm. Seems durable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Very Cute. Nice and thick material. Fit as expected and great color.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"We purchase these cute little shoes for our little son and since he is a boy we chose this navy blue and white combination for him.  It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.  Anyway, overall, this is a very worthy purchase.  It actually has a bit of room for his feet to grow into which is nice for it means that he will be able to use these for a longer period of time.
I was able to get this very nice item on a discount and I am glad to share to you all as well my fair and honest feedback about it.  My review on this product was based on my experienced with it through testing it or using it after receiving it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These are awesome tights but the camel toe they give...
I got a medium, fit very nicely. High waisted and a little too stretchy on the ankle. For size reference I'm 5'6, roughly 150lbs, and about a 28 in waist.

Update: I worked out for them for the first time, super comfy but crap they are thin. Squat proof but your panties line is extremely obvious. I also like the back of the calf panel of slightly preferated material."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,They are tight when I first put on but seem to be loosening up.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,a fine pair of denims jeans that rival more expensive brands in fit and finish
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I like this belt!  It arrived on time and in good packaging.  I was able to trim it to size with scissors and a lighter to prevent fray.  The buckle is cool, as well.  Please note the end of the belt I got is brown in color, looks like leather.  Belt is black.  Belt came in the black silk like bag with drawstring, which is nice touch if gifting."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,The bead I received was so pale it was barely green at all. It must have been very poor quality jade. I immediately returned it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"It fits well. No pains after walking 10km per round in my golf course,It is my favorite of all my 8 pairs of golf shoes, it seats well on the ground, water proof leaving my feet dry whenever I go through a wet course after rains. The design of the strings are most amazing without the two ends coming together yet your feet is fully covered."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,My husband works outside and wears these over his blue jeans during the winter days.  He said they are very comfortable and keep him warm.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Ordered this for my mother-in-law who has very small wrists and and needed something that was easy to put on. Was exactly what she wanted which was something very simple but feminine.

Great product great price."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I love the shoe I order a 8 1/2 there where a lil to small then I order a 9 there where to big the shoes their are nice and comfortable love the red.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,These shoes are pretty well made and pretty comfortable. The main purpose of these shoes is help those people around the world that would contract a disease through their feet and this is preventable. I do not work for Tom's Shoes but if your buying these shoes to last you for years or rock climbing than they are not for you.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Fit as  expected and didn't have to travel to a brick and mortar to get them
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This is my 2nd pair of Blundstone boots.  My other pair is model BL558.  Both pairs are the most comfortable boots ever.  No break-in period - they are perfect right out of the box.  Good quality leather and well made.  Highly recommend.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love this bag! It's large, long, and sturdy! The zipper is great as well, as most similar bags don't have one. Also, the color / pattern variation is random, I know, but I got just what I had hoped for!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This shoes is for 8 year old, he likes them. But after a month of use I can see thread hanging from them, it does not look like they will last long. However this happens to most of the shoes I get for him, I just expected more from this brand"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Nice regular shoe, kind of cool interior lining.  Fits well, looks good with jeans and other long legged garments.  Comfortable enough to work in, and play in.  Maybe not got running do much.
They're easy to clean with a brush or just brush if with your hands.
Everyone likes them and for some reason, I've begun to notice an uptick in conversation with women about shoes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Love this jacket, found it at a low price and it's amazing. My son feels confortable in it and looks great"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"My son loves this vest!  Fits great, comfortable, not too bulky."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,beautiful skirt at a great price. the length is flattering and the material is very soft but looks high quality.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I bought them in black after loving them in brown.

They are lightweight, cuter than Emus, and way more economical than Uggs.  They are warm and comfortable enough for all day wear. After a few wears, they soften and are more wearable.

I don't know how they would hold up in actual snow, but they are fine in the rain."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have grandsons 5 and 7. 5 is average height. 7 a little tall for age. We are taking then on a long train ride from NY to San Diego with stops in Grand Canyon, lots of kid things in San Diego. I am a travel nanny by trade so being prepared is my motto!  They needed backpacks just big enough to carry a couple bottles of water an a good supply of snacks for hikes and carry their Fire for train rides. I thought this was going to be too small at first. But I easily put a bottle on outside and inside plus my Fire and plenty of room for snacks, some playing cards etc. The back has a small padded feature. I wondered if straps would fit 7 yr old and I can adjust to even fit me! Best part? So light even with stuff that even my 5 year old won't complain! The stretchy from cords can even carry a small stuffed animal for sleep later.

I will do an update after trip (if still alive) and give feedbacks. With kids, go as small as you can and still do the job!

Update: These were perfect and now after trip they use it on long bike rides with dad.

I liked it so much that I got one for myself for my Scotland trip in Oct. I can not do heavy backpacks and when out being a tourist, purses are a bother. Great for plane as will hold a travel blanket, fire and tablet, phone and cords plus a bottle.

Very useful and inexpensive!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Very good looking, well-made shoe. My grandson loves his Chucks, as he calls them. He wears them to work, but he does add gel arch support soles as he's on his feet a lot."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I read other reviews which said to buy half a size larger, as is normal with a dance shoe, but they were huge when I got them.  I would've been fine with my normal size. Good quality shoe, however."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,cute gag gift i don't smoke but husband thought it was real and got a good laugh
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this for Halloween this year. I read the reviews stating that it fit a little small so to order one size bigger than you normally would. I normally wear large and XL so I ordered the XXL.  I have to have 2 people help with the zipper in the back in order to zip it and the top portion is smaller than the rest, but it fits okay. Also, if you are larger up top, definitely go for the bigger size. The material is stretchy which is the only reason the dress fit. It is very nicely made material and look wise. As most of the reviews say, you'll definitely want to order the petticoat as the shortness of it made me cringe & I am only 5'3""."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"The shoes are everything I expect from a pair of Chuck Taylors.  They look good and tend to last a decent amount of time.  For me personally, I get those Dr Sholls inserts to accommodate the lack of arch support."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Beautiful boots but had to return them as the calves of my legs were to big for them
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Nice comfortable cotton shirt, many other are polyester, and cost the same price."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,The boot is comfortable but in one little snow fall inside the boot got wet. My sock was wer at the corners.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"At first I thought these were going to be too small and uncomfortable with the heel insert, but I've worn them several times now and they fit great and are very comfortable. I was used to bulkier socks and first time wearing I left my laces in pretty much the same position.  Second time I tightened them up quite a bit so my feet were snug in my sneaker and this worked great.  So, so far so good.  I am washing out by hand after each wear."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I decided to try this style as a change.  My mistake.  After a month of wearing them, I've found the button fly is difficult to unbutton and re-button.  Otherwise, the pants fit well and wear well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"SIZE IS NOT ACCURED, YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN THE BUYERS THAT IF YOU ARE SIZE 10, YOU NEED TO ORDER SIZE 11 AND WIDE, BECAUSE I HAVE NORMAL FEET AND THIS DID NOT FIT ME AT ALL."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"It's a Casio, so I know it will last.  Just a little disappointed in the weight. I like heavier watches, and this is pretty lightweight."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Very cute and lightweight. The only reason I gave 4 stars is I am afraid if they a rent kept in a case they will break easily (they have not broken yet!)
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,So after a year or two one of the zips decides to fall off so now it doesn't zip properly.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,Says size 4-10. Whatever. Not for a 4 that's for sure.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,Looked as expected but no give in the fabric and it was really to small. Will return to get a bigger size.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This bracelet is so pretty.  I really like it.  The only thing I would consider a problem is the bracelet snags clothing.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Looks great on my daughter.  Fits very well.  The belt is a bit to long though.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,I have had this for a while and just recently the ribbon around the bust got loose in the wash; otherwise it has held up quite well. It is a satiny material and comfortable to sleep in even in tropical climates. Colors remain vibrant and other than the issue listed above it looks new. I would repurchase for sure. If you are larger than a D cup I doubt you would be able to fit the cups but you could always wear a lounging bra with same.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Overall I really do like this product its long, its cute, it works, the only problem is that it is cheaply made... I had mine for less than a month and one of the straps broke, its nothing a sewing kit won't fix but it would be nice if I didn't have to do such things."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"the toes were a little pointy for my taste, and the calf was a tad tight, but most boots on me are."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Love these! Very comfortable, perfect for between seasons when you're done with boots, but not quite ready for sandles?"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These were better quality than I thought. Super soft and stretchy, fits good."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,These shoes are adorable. But the problem is they did not last long.  I would last for like 5 months.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Overall, it fits a little looser than what I was looking for, but since I didn't realize it was a ""loose fit"" when I purchased the item that's to be expected. It's still a really comfortable hoodie and I wear it quite often."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love how these fit and they match everything with a pair of jeans.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Good price and very simple just like i wanted it for my pirate costume.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Comfortable, great support, yet still pretty and feminine. Love it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I have these boots in many colors. Fit perfect and are great quality.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This is a beautiful costume. Nicely constructed with quality materials & a zip-up back. The costume does not look like many of the other cheap princess dresses out there. You will love it! People thought I had made the dress because of the quality look. It fit true to size. Only down side, the elastic at the arms is too tight. I removed the elastic & the sewing still keeps the sleeve shape but this change made it wearable for my daughter. I took  1-star off for the sleeve issue. But overall its a 5-star dress."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Well, you have to wear white otherwise you see right through it. The fabric is so thin anything dark like a lanyard with your ID is very visible."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,The quality is good and I like the soft gray color
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These look great on, and they survive through several rounds of beach volleyball and swimming in the ocean! Great sunnies!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Just received these boots and I've got to say, they are so cute, stylish and very comfortable.  I'm about a size 9 (although as I get older I think my feet are shrinking), so based on other reviews I ordered a 1/2 size down -- 8.5. They fit perfectly.

There's extra room in the boot but I don't feel comfortable ordering down any smaller and want to leave space for socks.  These boots look/feel as if they would hold up in snow but I've yet to try.  However, you certainly don't need to wait for snow to wear these funky boots.  In fact, your girl (me ) will be sporting them this weekend.

Weekend weather forecast and temp: sunny and mid-40s. My forecast and temp: stylin' and hot!  Highly recommend."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I've tried several nursing bras and they all are too small or uncomfortable. This one was the best I tried so I went back and bought another.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"I was excited to purchase these due to the pretty colors offered and the reviews posted. The first time I went to use them though, I regretted my decision. They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed as the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love these brook  addiction walking.  They wear like iron and re the most comfortable shoe I have worn.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"They fit perfectly (even at the calves!) and are super comfortable to walk around in (level surfaces, up and down stairs etc). A little disappointed that the buckles on the back are only cosmetic, but the soles are so bad-ass (compared to most other women's fashion boots). Can't wait to try them out on ice / snow. Winter, bring it on!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,This shirt fits great! So comfy and looks exactly like it does in the picture.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,Fits well.  Just a plain black pump.  Not especially stylish but fits my need for a plain black pump.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Started out feeling a little small but ones I had them on for awhile they fit perfectly and were very comfortable.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,Comfy but not quite as good for my foot as Converse (I have a flat foot that's picky)
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews on this bag, but I was pleasantly surprised with it once it arrived. First of all, this is a very, very large bag. Almost too big for everyday use. It would be a great diaper bag or travel bag. It comes with a removable shoulder strap which is great. It has several pockets, but they're quite large as well. A drop in bag organizer would be great for this. The quality is a little less that I would like. The canvas is very thin and the lining is this as well. I'm not sure how this bag would hold up to everyday use. I checked the stitching on it and it seems pretty sturdy. My favorite thing about this handbag is the color. I got the yellow and blue and I think it's absolutely gorgeous. My only worry about this bag is how well it will hold up over time, but I will update my review if needed. At this point, I would recommend this bag to anyone needing a larger than normal tote. This would definitely have you covered."

They are very comfortable and I can wear them for long periods but they are wearing out, or something. I am fairly careful with shoes and they haven't been wet, or ill-treated. No complaints about the fit or comfort but am disappointed in the quality. Won't be able to wear them much longer."

I ordered a large which fit a little snug but flattered my figure nicely. The material is very stretchy and the peplum helps hide any tummy bulges.

The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'.  Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy.  William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,My daughter has been watching the Supernatural series from the very start and was missing the seventh season. I bought it for her as a black Friday deal so it was super cheap and it arrived in record time. She loves it! I recommend it to anyone who loves Supernatural.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  Slow to start as characters are being developed but a really great tear jerker.  Happy tears.
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.

The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.

Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.

Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.

I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.

Step up to the plate, Marvel.  Play time's over."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I'm not about to cower in awe of what so-called ""critics think.  As quite an eclectic connosieur of film I found this one lacking in most everything except cinematography.  But even that doesn't save this film which literally put me to sleep.  My only motivation for staying awake was the gnawing belief that surely  at some point a plot would finally emerge to justify enduring the lack thereof heretofore.  But it finally dawned on me as the credits rolled that I had been had.  What I don't understand is why the critics or Alton think that sitting through hours of watching people, one would barely tolerate in real life, chat about nothing for 2 hours constitutes an important film or even entertainment for that matter.  And I happen to like good English film. But if I am to give up 2 hours of my life, I just think there should be a point."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Especially for fans of ""Romeo and Juliet"" this film has much to offer. The changes in the story are interesting. Much of the acting is good, especially from the lovers. It is a spectacular film to watch. The biggest disappointment is the songs. They are not particularly exciting to hear or see. When the songs are dull in a Bollywood film, the film really suffers."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"The movie is calm; no real highs or lows. The actors are going through a change in their lives and they do it in a run down hotel in India.  I find it funny the power movies have over us and the brainwashing that it tries to do.  In this movie they try to make you feel bad for homosexuals, make you feel unmarried sexual relationships are okay because of loneliness, and that marriages that are strained should just end.  They show the only married couple splitting and doing it as easy as ""turning left"".  Besides this lack of morality I did enjoy the movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"This was almost unwatchable.  My question?  Did Jeremy Renner need the money?
I really don't have much else to say about this movie.  There were 2 times the F word was used and for no real reason.  It was rather a gratuitous use of the word.  J. Renner said it once and it was seemed so ridiculous.  The names Hansel and Gretel also seemed ridiculous as well in this movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.

With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.

Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.

I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.  I was so pleased with its faithfulness to the novel, and I looked forward to seeing the other books adapted. However, despite the good things they did in Prince Caspian, overall it was too disappointing to watch again, and I have no desire to watch The Voyage of the Dawn Treader."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I actually bought this once, gave it away, and am re-purchasing it now (at a lower price because it's older and demand long ago dwindled).  I watch the series one character at a time and never re-watch Paul's messed up personal life (the only character who continues to devolve instead of evolve).  It's the depth of interaction between client, client's inner world, and therapist that delights me most: the slow crumbling of defenses, the re-connection with inner truths, the breakthroughs, the increase in functionality.  My favorites in Season 2 are the older businessman and the young female college student."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Add me to the list of admirers!  An absolutely original story line by the amazing Moffat AND one of the best performances I have ever seen, bar none.  My daughter shared this with me recently, and as with all Moffat's work, she kept noticing things she had not seen the first time around.  Well worth purchasing."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie.
Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I think Seinfeld rates on most peoples lists as one of the greatest comedies of all time. I rank Seinfeld in my top 5. I was holding off buying this set as it was insanely expensive for a very long time, but with the deal amazon had I just had to have it. I have not been disappointed one bit. The extras including the dvd and the coffee table book are all excellent. If your a Seinfeld fan and do not own this then you really are not a true fan."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.  And as everyone has already stated, this film is in widesreen and looks mighty sweet.  NO COMPLAINTS.  I can't give this set 5 stars because I think FEAR is not worthy.  BUt if you can find this cheaper than the stated price, maybe $10 or so, then you're taking about a 5 star purchase."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack. The story and performances bear up under repeated viewings.  Comedy fans will enjoy it again and again!"
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version.  In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more  fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and  some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director.  Might be  worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which  eventually will happen."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I saw the original film when it hit the theatres as a preview for public school history classes when I was teaching in San Antonio somewhere in early 70's. I was entranced by Christopher Plummer's rendition of the trusting Incan ruler. For its time, the film-making was spectacular. More importantly, the film was an important one--one of the first to reveal the cruel treatment of natives."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to? Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichd cheesy line like some dinners are worth fighting for into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"It is definitely not the style of movie that I like, but I loved, I think, the entire cast's acting. Robert De Niro is one of my very favorite actors, and as I very much expected, he did not disappoint. I also loved Jody Foster, I have seen many movies of hers, and I also love her acting very much. I liked Peter Boyle also, whom I got to know from ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and from what I saw in Taxi Driver, there is a mischievous quality about him that seems to come through always. And last, but not least, Harvey Keitel just blew my mind! If you haven't seen it yet and like, or at least tolerate, this particular genre of gore, I'm willing to bet that, in seeing these actors' work in their beginnings will show clearly and unmistakably the reason why they have become huge stars and received so many accolades."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Having had to sit through the ""horror"" films that the Hollywood studios have given hideous birth to these past couple of years, I was in the mood for some good old fashioned imported hair raising terror. I had read about this film before going to see it, mostly because I had read a novel of the same title by Jeff Long which is about a terrifying cave exploration gone wrong, but this movie directed by Neil Marshall is a completely different story although similar in its originality. I dragged my husband to see this last night, promising him a different experience than all the horror movies as of late. We both are sick of paltry remakes of Japanese films, and big budget stinkers that involve lots of water and hair, and rely heavily on computer generated scares , This movie is a serious monster movie for a generation without monster movies. I really missed the good old days where the baddies were flesh and bone; the stories were fresh and didn't need too much elaboration, and I had the chance to see some unknowns get massacred. This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying ""okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it"" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the ""the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc"" out of my system. I cant wait to buy this on DVD and see the other ending, any extras, and relive one of the best movies I have seen in years."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"When Mark Wahlberg openly implies the mistake he made in taking on the role he played in this film, you know there's a serious problem.

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

To any potential viewers, be forewarned. There's not much of anything ""happening"" throughout this entire movie."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Why do I love this show?

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

DISCLAIMER: Though the writers are good at what they do, don't listen to any of their commentaries.  They are exceptionally boring, lackluster, and have slightly soured my enjoyment of the show.  It's that bad."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!  Oh well, that's modern film-making for you -- where directors and writers confuse their own aspirations for social change and ""influencing the masses"" with authentic telling of history.  Advice: stick to authentic documentaries, and keep fresh batteries in your BS detector."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it."

At the same time, it keeps the viewer laughing with funny jokes, quirky characters and funny situations."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,This movie has become quite rare.  It's set in a parallel world of Hollywood Babylon in the late thirties.  The shocking climax never fails each time.
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,I LIKED THIS MOVIE ITS A WESTEREN TO THE FULLEST AND BALE IS JUST AWESOME THIS IS A PURCHASABLE MOVIE DVD!!
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Way before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s.

Having made a smash in ""The Karate Kid"" and the '60s-nostalgia TV series ""Call to Glory"", Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled Adventures in Babysitting.

Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date.

All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago.

Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too.

In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone) gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably.

Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.

This comedy flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987."

If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL. Michael O'SHEA looks a little too old and his uniform is a few sizes too small...to bad they didn't cast PERRY COMO in this leading role. Also O'SHEA is not the best singer either...most all other cast members do a great job...EXCEPT...PHIL SILVERS who is loud and ANNOYING!
Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer. Only problem I had is in the EXTRA FEATURES: The ""STILL GALLERY"" feature in my copy doesn't allow my access to it...used two different DVD players and both had the same problem. The Film, Scenes, Trailer, and the SUPERB DOCUMENTARY are no problem. The documentary is in four parts...great interviews, vintage still photos and live performances, both candids and her FOX production numbers make this one of the best Documentaries out there...the Documentary is worth the price of this DVD ALONE!

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for.
Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen.
""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe.
Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending.
There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more.
To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"If you have ever taken an exercise class that has totally kicked your butt & you are looking to get that kind of workout at home - this is it!!  When you are done you know that you just did a serious work out. It's approximately 48 minutes of constant cardio that includes an active aerobic warm up and about 6 minutes of cool down & stretching.  I am in fairly good shape although I have some weight to lose and I find this workout an excellent challenge.  If you are just starting out exercising I would think that this would be a bit too much to take on although JM does show some easier versions of some of the exercises.
A note about JM - I have to admit that I have never been a fan of hers previously.  When I would see her on the Biggest Loser she would rub me the wrong way.  However, after trying this workout I am a big fan now!  She is one awesome trainer & is able to get that across even via video.  Some people have commented that she does a lot of talking during this video and that is true - but it doesn't really matter what she's doing....it's what you do that matters :)"

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

I believe the final fade out poses this question."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"My standards for movies are relatively simple - the plot has to engage me to the end without offending my intellect or my spiritual understanding of the world, the storyline should have redemptive value, and the action and script should be believable and appropriate to the situation portrayed. This movie sits on my shelf because it fits all these categories.
It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lies it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin lines of nuance while David Norse was achingly fragile and volatile.
Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating. I think this is one of them. The language and violence in this film are wholly appropriate to the subject matter, and thankfully, all other offensive content was cut during the editing process.
A taut, emotional action film with a gratifying end."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Two of Jack Nicholson's best ever tantrum scenes
If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's one scene in which Nicholson REALLY doesn't want to invite his ditsy girlfriend (Karen Black) to come along to the family home to visit his dying father - and when he realizes he can't get out of it, he sits in his car and comes unglued. Then he get out, goes back inside and very calmly says, ""Rayette, you wanna come with me?""
The other one is in a roadside caf when the laconic waitress won't alter the menu selections by one jot - and again he comes unglued as only Nicholson can do when he's at the top of his performance, which he usually is.
But the rest of this movie is dark, dark, dark - a mood piece of a dysfunctional family. Nicholson plays a wounded outcast, a former piano prodigy who has been estranged from his father for years, spending his time as an oil worker in Texas, shacking up with his annoying girlfriend. When he learns his father is dying in Washington State, he sets off for 'home.' Most of the rest of the film is an odyssey, a road trip back to the family mansion and all he's left behind: his attachments, his family, his problems, his fears, and his failures.
Five Easy Pieces became a classic almost as soon as it was released. Don't miss it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I know:  many viewers resented the apparent lack of physical chemistry between the characters played by Connery and Zeta-Jones.  Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and  Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of  Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual,  and sexual ?  I find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people  enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the  same thing ! - but as it happens in life, people perform so much better  when they really like what they do.  The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones  youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident, more inward  quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime  experience.  As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the  old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.  Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of  his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.  While, at  the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually  liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between  Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair  and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with  occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.  Watch and  enjoy the movie, as I did, for what it is not for what it is not !"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is the dictionary of bellydance- 2 discs- she goes through standing moves, traveling moves, veil and zill introductions, and some combinations.  Very useful and it is voiced over- she doesn't stop moving, the narration explains what she is doing.  I like how she doesn't dissect things to the point where you can't foresee what you trying to do.  She does the movements up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns.  Beautiful variety of costumes, Jehan illustrates that you don't have to have a model's figure to be a gorgeous sexy dancer- she is so beautiful!

I recomend that you also get 'the ultimate bellydance workout' with this dvd set because that dvd is fantastic and this set explains what the dancers in the other dvd are doing.  If you have the other and were discouraged because you couldn't quite get how they were doing certain moves, this dvd set explains it all."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.

I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.

It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I will say it up front, yes this was a film never previously seen in America, maybe it still has not been. It is from the 1970's, and just about outdoes most other genre entries (no pun intended) in terms of the degree of sleaze radiating off the screen.

Another film where you could speed the film up 4-5 times and quite easily follow the plot, what little there is of it.

I found it interesting to study the eyes of the people 'acting' in this film, there is a lot of uneasiness amid the sleaze on show.

It is really a straight porn shoot (and it is without a doubt X-rated) with one or two lesbian scenes which would have been pretty radical for those days (I'm guessing).

To give an indication of the story and plot standard, the short sex scenes which were often threatening to break out into a very laid back orgy, well those X-rated scenes were the actual highlight of the entire mess on show.

It must have cost a fair bit to make, as it is well shot for the era, and whoever was behind the camera had at least some idea of what they were doing.

I cannot comment on the dialogue as I couldn't bear to expose myself to it (it was dubbed anyway I think, which compounds the agony).

And if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD based on the jacket featuring a gorilla obviously rather taken with a diverting buxom blonde, you will be sadly disappointed.

There is a lame sex scene involving the bloke in the gorilla suit, with a young woman who obviously is unhappy, does not want her face caught on film, and raises the possibility whether she was aware of what was going on or even whether she felt under a little duress during that scene.

Which brings me back to the central point, yes, this is sleaze with a capital 'S'; you sort of do get what was advertised, but it is so tame and takes itself seriously by today's 'standards' it is almost quaint."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,This precurser to The Lord of the Rings is a wonderful lead into the much deeper work. It gives background into the former. Although it is not as well developed as the later work-it is truly wonderful and not to be dismissed as inferior.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I was so glad all the characters were very appealing and kept  my interest. I think the more I watch movies with different life styles I will be more excepting to it. I know these are just movies, but you can get the questions answered without putting people on the spot. I wanted to know how do gay people have sex? And how do they go about meeting one another in public? Thank you for providing answers and a different perspective!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,This movie was for my mom. We really enjoyed this true story. If your a dog lover?! This is a must own!
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This is the final in the series of a long running and great TV show.  The eleventh and twelfth season episodes clearly lack the polish and good story lines of all the other episodes.  James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth seasons is sorely missed.  As good as the new characters are such as William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines.  It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord was not the easiest individual to work with.  His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth.  Without Danno and all the other wonderful personalities around him, he rather fades into background.  The very final episode has Lord as the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat.  The episode quite fell flat (pardon the poor rhyme).  Seasons 1 through ten are stellar."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I was very disappointed with the theatrical release of this movie, especially since I was a big fan of the first two. This Extended Edition definitely helps fill in the blanks that were missing in the theatrical release."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"So, I got the New Line 2-disc version: both discs play the same material. Even though one is labeled ""Supplemental Material"" it just goes to the regular Main Title for the film with nothing else. Both discs do this. Maybe I got some funky error version where they accidentally put two of the same discs in the box; whatever the case, not happy."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Ok the actors are good but I expected something else. In this movie, the German soldiers and officers are just too kind ! I don't think that finally the whole story is believable. Don't expect the usual War movie with this one,You will finish in a court room mostly ! It's full of moral,justice,pride,honour...seen in far better acts before To end,this movie could have lasted 1:30 instead of the 2 LOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG hours : an eternity !"
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"this is a good summary of the years 1960-1963 but I found it too short and missing some events I think should have been added and that is why I gave only 4 stars, but in a whole it is well done"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.  Fortunately ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" has been restored and is now available so it can become the classic it deserves to be."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,One of the best movies i have ever seen. It is especially funny if  you have ever been in a bad relationship
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The acting is sweet and the ending is endearing. The story is charming, a bit sad and uplifting.  The music/songs are incredible! I will watch it again. The talent of this young man, Ethan 10 at this time, is extraordinary! I didn't suspect until the near end that he may be singing the songs. But, surely he couldn't be playing the piano so eloquently with such small fingers. Upon reading the credits - sure enough, he did sing, play the piano, write and produce this film. According to Ethan's online biography, he has made over $40 million for charity. He is one gifted guy."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Walter Matthau is at his best playing the three characters who all find themselves in the same hotel.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I prefer realism over Hollywood story telling.  This film is a great ""Popcorn"" type of War Movie, that in a way reminds me of the old 40's war movies.  The plot centers around a tank crew led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy""  (right away, when I see a War film with the characters all having nicknames, I know I am in for less than realism and more Hollywoodism).

There's a lot to like about this film.  It is entertaining, the sound effects are awesome (LOVE LOVE LOVE the .50 cal firing), there's suspense, tension, and afront to innocence brought into a combat scenario.

The tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screen writers (by that I mean, they are not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).  The combat is intense, although a bit too contrived.  I think actual combat would've seen the engagements they depict not turn out as depicted.

Still, I feel this film is worthy of 4 stars (the only reason I didn't go 5 is because of the realism factor)... I don't feel at all like I wasted my money.

I haven't addressed a story synopsis or plot lines because, to be quite honest, I don't want to spoil your viewing (if you've not seen it), and if you have, you know those speak for themselves.

I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a really really good war film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Just don't expect the same level of immersion as other films, such as Platoon, or Saving Pvt. Ryan...  I don't think that was the filmakers' aim in making this."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,These biblical movies are very good and scriptural. I ordered two by mistake and this one was sent back.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I watched it over two or three nights...before I had kids I would probably have just watched it straight through.  It's very well acted (the two leads are just giants) and provides a lot of local flavor; including religious and cultural lore---some of it tough to see.  It is very philosophical for those who haven't read the articles.  It is also gory and dark and shows some things that some people probably don't want or need to see, so not for everyone.  I also liked that the storyline ends at the end of the season; it is what it is with no chance for decline, sell-out, revisionism, inconsistency, et cetera.  I am looking forward to Season 2 and to Matthew McConaughey's next effort."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Great product. Everything I expected and more. Recieved it before I had a chance to even think about when it would com.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"to me,it's true.he always sounds the same,and that's always good.cool side interviews with him and other musicians in including dr.john and alan tuissant."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"O.k so people your right this one doesn't measure up to other Disney animated classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", but then again maybe that is not such a bad thing.  Anyone remember the little disaster in-a-box from 1996 ""Humpback?"" No well then count yourself blessed and spared by the divine hand of God  It was bad.
This movie was not bad, not at all in fact I rather enjoyed it.  The storyline was solid if not wholly original and the graphics were great, sorta reminded me of Titan A.E only this movie got me to laugh once in a while whereas Titan A.E didn't.  The voice actors also seemed to have a fun time with what they were doing.
The thing that killed this movie and why it so poorly at the box office was just the shear number of Treasure Island movies out there.  I'm sure that if this move had been a wholly orginal idea it would have been a box office smash, but unfortunately it was not.
If you have the opportunity to but this one go ahead and do it.  This movie will surly keep both you and the kids interested.  On the plus side for adults the annoying singing is kept to a minimum"
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Great movie... years ago I bought the DVD of these movies, they had 5.1 sound. I bought this for the 1080p quality but these are only 2 channel... What happened...? I would not buy this if you are like me and want the HD experience..."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,Doesn't come remotely close to being as entertaining as the original Hitman staring Timothy Olyphant
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Proof positive that what makes as great movie is the writing.  Don't get me wrong, this film looks great, but you can tell it did not have the giant blockbuster budget that some films have, but the director and camera crew make it look like a million dollars anyway.  And more importantly it has fantastic script, mood, and great actors! This is a thnking man's, or woman's, movie. it is also very much in the film noir vein.  Films to compare it to would be Dark City or the first Boerne Identity movie.  Through out the movie our main character has identity issues and as has been stated previously, Jeremy Northam's tranformation is incredible, subtle, and in my opinion, Oscar worthy! It has been said by some that the plot has holes or doesn't make sense in places. I have plotted it out meticullously and i can find a hole anywhere.  Because the plot is involved it is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. Much like watching ""The Usual Suspects"" for the second & third time. Something else I think is noteworthy is that while most of the movie is kind of cold and lonely,as it should be, as our hero goes on his quest where no one can be trusted, at the very end of the movie we are treated to a very warm, hopeful, satisfying ending. All the cast are perfect.  Lucy Lui has the perfect demeanor for this role. Many times it is hard to read her and thereby to know if she can be trusted.  Finally, let me end with stating this is in my Top-10 movies of all times along with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  In the Mouth of Madness by John Carpenter, as well as many other horror and Sci-fi films.  I watched more times than I can count and will probably go watch it again here in a minute. A real treat for anyone who has not seen it yet!"

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.

Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.

The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.

Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,It took five minutes for me to remember why I've never liked Adam Sandler. The misogyny in this movie is staggering.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Very good movie.  To think of the possibility that are world could be like in this movie.  I thought the movie was well written and had many good actors in it.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Gargoyles has got to be one of my all time Favorites and it an American production too, now that's really something. However, Disney on the other hand BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! I think that Disney is owned by a Secret Society and that's why they're so EVIL.(PH34R T3H 3V1L) Can you think of a better EXCUSE? Why is it at this time when Disney is restoring all of thier past successes, Master Pieces of all time, all of thier best productions, that at this time one of thier greatest TV series ever of all time is being forgotten? Have they forgotten Duck Tales? Gummi Bears? Dark Wing Duck? Tale Spin? Chip'N'Dale Rescue Rangers? No they are putting all of these shows on DVD. So how about finishing Gargoyles? Oh, and that reminds me is this Season 3 actually the Goliath Chronicles or is that still yet to come? I hope to see the other half of season 2 come soon and for the completion of season 3 without any breaks like there is in season 2. So Come on Disney get with the freakin' program already 'cause dragging yer feet is so yesterday."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This series is amazing! Even if it only has a handful of episodes, it's so well-plotted and most of the characters are amazingly acted. Heather was underutilized, but I won't get into that for brevity and sanity's sake. I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?
 I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,So amazing.  Transforms your mind to to Harry Potter world
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story. Some artistic lapses in the directing are made up for by the exceptional final act."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"After viewing these 4 films once again, I realize how important some twentieth century films are to our understanding of ourselves, our religons, the way we love one another, and the way we deal with death. The artistry is within every frame. There is one interview documentry with Bergman in 1998 with one of his assocites, it is clear that as Bergman got older and older, he wanted to dis-associate himself from these early acheivements. Why? He states that although he knew he was master of the medium (and theater as well)that his personal life, was just a series of bitter disappointments ending with the death of his last wife, Ingrid I beleive. So, he assumed himself to be just an anonymous technician, or at least that's what he wished. The only compliant I have is that the subtitles are inside of the visual image instead of being letter boxed and the subtitles are sloppily inserted. Not up to Criterion criteria. One new observation is that the ensamble cast that Bergman uses throughout most of these films are one of the reasons these movies are the classics that they are. Lastly, Bergman films aren't made to be watched once and discarded, they are made to be re-inestigated year-in and year-out."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

Guide: F-bomb. Nudity."

The widescreen print looks very good and is in color. I mention this because when I was growing up in the 60's we had a black and white TV set and watching this DVD was the first time I saw this film in color!

Like other Warner releases there isn't any extras, but a trailer. The price is steep, but Warner does run specials, which can bring the price down between $12.00 and $14.00. If you want the film at a reasonable price, wait until they run a sale."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The vast majority of international terrorism conducted on a spectacular scale is State-sponsored. A faction or network of government uses its access to the levers of power to promote actions in various ways. As withe the Red Brigades the Baader-Meinhof faction showed their gullibility because both groups were created by and controlled by NATO intelligence. Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly. In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted. Two other celebrated signature cases are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang  protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof was acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6. Putting this as a backdrop the the film increases its importance significantly and allows the viewer to connect the missing dots."

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The Winter Kills is the first of three failed attempts to launch a crime series for Andy in the 70's.
A masked killer reading a journal is killing citizens of a small ski town that Andy is the sheriff of. As the bodies pile up and the town panics, Andy closes in on the killer.
 Well made and creepy,  this movie is a fine piece of the 70's crime shows."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I can't believe I have never seen this before, Was delightful to see a new one."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Very entertaining movie! Loved it and can't wait for the next Chapter!
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER.
Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is a fun movie, and one of the most entertaining movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The plot is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity: a bunch of innocent people, plus a cop, are on a bus. A terrorist has put a bomb on the bus, so if the bus slows down everyone blows up and dies. And the bus happens to be on an ordinary, crowded big city highway. So once you realize ( very early on in the movie ) that the bus is definitely *not* going to blow up, you can enjoy the ride. So once we're handed the simple, bare-bones scenario, we get to see every single complication that can occur with one speeding bus, scared people, and public roads. Every single possibility of loss of life and horrible danger is explored in loving detail. That is where this movie gets really fun: just sit back and enjoy the ride. That's all you have to do with this movie."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I still can't get over what a 'find' this film was.  I've never been to New Zealand, and the beautiful cities and seascapes alone were enough to give this film five stars!  The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.  The movie challenged it's viewers to think about life choices, desires, and the realtiies of following your heart."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,It's a great series with a story and excellent actors. You'll get hooked on it after the first few episodes.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,A very interesting piece of history. From this movie's perspective there were more conspirators involved but were never charged.
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.
The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.
""Iron Man"" is a much better super hero movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"a delightful visionary work that features a lovable cast of characters that often prove surreal as well as very human.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"THIS season is finally starting to show the cast in their true memories. No more ""guests"" as the ""hosts"" for the entire show; the cast gets to develop their style and really enjoys performing. Much better than the 1st and 2nd DVD sets. Laugh till you can't breathe! That's what the original members made you do!  Who cares about the price of gasoline."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,This hit the spot for my geography class.  We learned so much about current knowledge and new theories.  It made my students think.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.
While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.
Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father.
While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances. The remastered copy is easier on the eyes."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,Sometimes it is hard to get into a different reality.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"When I first saw this movie I was blown away by Jim Carrey.  With the exception of a few moments I forgot that it was him in the film.  Jim truley became Andy Kaufman.  I cannot think of a better performance from  anyone this year.
While the film may not have pleased everyone, I for  one loved it.  It was made the way that Andy Kaufman would have wanted it  made.  No one could tell where the truth ended and the fiction began.  This  is a great way to remember the genious of Andy Kaufman."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.

Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.

A couple plot elements have gotten me a little confused so far, but it is negligible at this point, and I am hoping is cleared up by the time I watch the last episode."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This Swedish comedy is set in 1970 and takes a look at life in a commune in Stockholm. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) runs away from her drunken husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), after he hits her in the face, taking along her 13-year-old daughter and son who is eight or nine. They land up with Elizabeth's brother who lives in a hippie commune where the members are all committed to socialism, vegetarianism, feminism and open-marriage but cannot agree whose turn it is to do the washing up.

The poor kids feel humiliated and estranged among a bunch of immature adults -- and their father's efforts to win back their trust only make things worse. But slowly they begin forming relationships with other kids their own age. Meanwhile Elizabeth is introduced to feminist ideas expressed by the radical notion of allowing her underarm hair to grow. We soon learn that behind the empty slogans of the hippies lies deep hypocrisy -- and we eventually learn what it takes to form a real community bound by ties of love and affection. Along the way there are many funny moments.

What I liked about this movie, apart from the Abba soundtrack, is that the characters change and grow -- and that the ideological points it makes are delivered subtly instead of being hammered home."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"The cover of the movie is a great portrayal of how the movie is going to go.
I thoroughly enjoyed this Poe-twist story line.  It gave some detail in the beginning of the movie (his anguish, tormented life), to keep you hooked to the end. As in his (Poe's) books; the fast-beating heart, time ticking away fervently, and turmoil to keep you always on the edge of your seat, was done well.  At times (Poe) could come off as being too brash.  But inevitably, you wound up feeling sorry for him. Each piece of the plot gently wound it's way to a complete story that would of course only end the Edgar Allen Poe way."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece depicting yet another episodic take on the seemingly never-ending conflict between Good and Evil...

Combining a pristine and innocent imagination with the heart and soul of a poet, the young heroine Ofelia is seemingly over-matched against the consummate evil of Fascism that has possessed Franco's Spain.  Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.  Del Torro leaves it to the discretionary viewer to decide where fantasy ends and magical reality begins.

Within the magical fantastic occurrences between Ofelia and her fantasy/magical beings are contained lessons in life given to the all-too-human Ofelia.  They provide not only a means of escape but of real life survival, which strongly argues for more than the products of a young but gifted girl's prodigious imagination.

A great and timely movie that deserves all the attention it has received."

Even though Steve Jackson did not give us as much extra material in the Hobbit films as he did in the Extended LOTR, the Extended Battle of Five Armies has substantially more material than the theatrical edition.  It also ties up some loose ends that exist in the theatrical film.  For people who like short, simple films, this entire series is too long.  For people who love Tolkien, and understand why a film cannot be the same as a book, it is too short.  Recommended."

Saw the film in its original theatrical run, was ready to leave the Uptown Theater in D.C. but realized Carol Burnett still had more to do, so I stayed.  Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that:
30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.  Would love to hear comments/clarifications on this."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,Great moments.  Breathtaking Cinematography.  Deviates from historical accuracy about 2/3 of the way through in the cause of storytelling which I can forgive but the story was... average.  (Spoiler). Grizzly bear attack was awesome.  Some explicitness (rape).

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"This movie was made in the mid 1990s in Spain, it was directed by Jim McBride, based on a novel by Perez Reverte, and it stars a young Kate Beckinsale. Sounds promising? The movie's not. Basically, the plot has Beckinsale (with a boyish short hair cut) playing an art student in Barcelona, who finds that a flemish painting holds clues to some murder, or something. The whole thing is very dull, full with ridiculous situations and characters. The only thing to recommend for it is a couple of nude scenes by the young Kete (one in particular, with Kate topless for many seconds looking at a painting and sporting a grannie's panties is particularly memorable)."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"After viewing ""His Last Vow,""  I am left absolutely stunned and I cannot wait to see what happens next.  I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.  The supporting cast is wonderful and I am glad that Mycroft, Molly, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson have been given more screen time."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"A difficult subject matter, but definitely worth seeing.  Richly developed characters and unique story line.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Great lead performances by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton highlight this film along with great supporting performances by Maureen Stapleton and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill.

Beatty plays journalist John Reed, a journalist very passionate about his views and was witness to the Russian Revolution in the 1910's. The movie provides insights into his idealistic views along with his romantic relationship with Louise Bryant (Keaton) whom he had a very passionate but also quite stormy relationship.

Jack nearly steals the show as O'Neill, a man very much in love with Bryant despite the fact that her heart really belongs to Reed.

And Stapleton won a well deserved Oscar as Emma Goldman, a woman who shared a lot of the same views as Reed, and initially had no use for Bryant until much later.

It's a political movie but it's also a love story and it works well with both. Definitely a must-see."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This film doesn't pretend to be perfect.  It is open about how flawed people move forward amidst the heartbreak that each of us undoubtedly encounter in our fallen world. Instead of a movie saying, ""here is a package that ties with a silk ribbon on top"" it instead says ""walk along with me, I am hurting too, and I am willing to respond in an inclusive manner rather than hardening in my isolation and spitting my hatred all over anyone that comes close""...It is this message that I found refreshing, and maybe even a little inspiring.  If you like independent films for the performances that seem to set celebrities free from micro managed scripts...you will probably like 'Begin Again'."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This was my first real viewing (start to finish) of the movie. It's worth a watch if you've never seen it. Not sure if it's one to watch every year, however (as I do  the 1951 ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alastair Sim as Scrooge, or ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with Jimmy Stewart & Donna Reed).

There are some amusing moments - and one sight gag (a la Keystone Cops) that is overused. For me, the intrigue of this movie was less about Ralphie (the main character) and more about the eccentric father and how diametrically opposed the mother was. How in the heck did THESE two hook up? Given that, the movie takes a somewhat surprising but very warm, heartfelt turn - and you're left feeling that all is right with the world."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"""Knowing"" (2009) is directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow, I,Robot). This film is about a time capsule that is opened fifty years later with pictures drawn by children, however, one of the pictures drawn by a child was only filled with numbers. This sheet of numbers falls into the hands of a scientist who discovers that they predict various disasters. This is the second time over the past two years that I have seen this film, but this was the first time that I had seen it on blu-ray, and this really is the way to see this film. It's a beautifully directed apocalyptic sci-fi film that looks and sounds amazing (DTS HD Master Audio;5.1 Dolby Digital). There was one scene of a forest fire that was so vivid with the crackling sounds of fire that I felt I was right in the middle of a forest fire. When I first saw this film on dvd I thought that it was okay, but it was only after seeing it on the blu-ray format that I really appreciated its majestic beauty. If one has enjoyed the ""X-files"" TV series then one may enjoy this film too."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Punch-Drunk Love is a decent movie with a sweet romance. It was slightly disappointing in that the whole movie seemed to hint at something more. I wholly expected a bit more character development, a bit more action (not in the ""Action Movie"" sense, but just in the ""get off your butt and do something"" sense), and a bit more resolution to the story. It seemed like the most interesting aspects of the story and the characters was only hinted at, and we never got to see them up close. It seemed like so much more could have been done with Barry's family, the love story, and virtually everything else in the movie. Not bad, just not nearly as good as it could have been."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Very good action movie they thought they could invade the USA they were wrong chuck Norris kicks but lots of over the top action you gotta love the final showdown
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"The information in the video is good.  The problem with the video is production.
This is a series of Jason Martel's lectures that he is just doing a recorded presentation of.  He has a picture in picture of himself talking to you in the lower part of the screen.  The slide presentation has not been optimized for this and his video covers up much of the data (charts, imagery...) he is trying to describe.
More often than not he is staring/talking at his computer screen highlighting parts of the imagery with his mouse instead of the audience.  This could have just had him narrating without the video of him.  I would assume the rest of the DVD series is more of the same.
The audio is recorded over the computer mic and has that very hollow speakerphone-ish sound.  You can understand what is being said, but sound is annoying.
Overall, lots of potential, but a complete fail on delivery."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,Very entertaining musical drama about a black Aboriginal singing group from Australia who sing soul songs of the sixties to soldiers in Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam war. Filmed in Australia and Vietnam.
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,Did not like very much. To much cussing in that movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Loved it when I was a kid, bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Maybe I'll be able to watch it with my great-granddaughter in 20 years.  I'll only be 80!"
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,Fine movie. Not the best. Not the worst. Good time killer if you like sci-fi shooters.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"What a wonderful movie this is! The triumph of form over content portrayed with icy precision. Characters acknowledge each other  mostly in terms of self-absorbed one-upsmanship. Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short. Don't miss this film. It's also very funny. You just have to meet Patrick Bateman, a really swell guy."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Two very enjoyable movies. I have watched them at least a couple of times each. With all of the junk that's
out there on the market, it's nice to watch movies without all the filthy language and blood & guts."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,The beauty and emotion of this portrayal of two very different worlds coming together was well done. I'm brought to tears every time I watch it. The soundtrack is consuming and hypnotic.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great documentary that really brings you as close to the action as you can get on film. Andy Rooney started out as a reporter on a B-17 aircraft and takes you through a mission that he experienced. It shows you the tragedy of planes not returning and young men coming back from the battle dead or wounded. It also includes interviews of several veterans of the air war. When I watch this film, I try to visualize what it was like to be shot down in a B-17, then captured and put into a NAZI's prison camp as my uncle was! Would I have found the strength to endure?"
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Ok, I'm putting I don't like it because I watched it 2 weeks ago and I've already forgotten everything about it. So I must not have liked it. I only know it was in sub-titles. Can't remember a single other thing."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I've been looking for this movie, at last I owned it now on DVD.
I received this today.  Right now I'm watching it here in my PC.
And later when I get home , I'll play this on my player. Watch it all over again."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandaughter. She loves these T.V. shows & she learns a lot from them (she can count up to 10, knows all of her shapes & colors,  knows the letters of the alphabet, can understand & speak some -a fairly good amount of- Spanish, her vocabulary is way above the level of a 3 year old, and she can read some words in books).  She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving). This DVD will be especially good for the long trips we take (over 2 hours). Anyone with little ones will know how much education kids can absorb while watching something they enjoy! I highly recommend this DVD."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Really enjoyed the first 3 episodes of season 1 I have watched.  It is an Adult only film, but if you like Sci Fi.  This is a good one."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I think the only reason I like this movie is because I haven't seen the Orignal. Most people who have seen the orginal and enjoyed it shouldn't even try to watch a re-make, not just for this film but any because no matter how good it was they'll hate it. I have to say I enjoyed all the re-makes so far. ""The Grudge""; ""One Missed Call"" and so on and so forth. I also like these because I haven't seen the org: The movie is worth watching."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,A great movie with all of the dark mood you could ever want. There are other movies with similar story lines but this one was very well done.  I highly recommend it if you would like to see a good large Budget horror/suspence movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"An illogical horror film about a demoniac trapped in a mirror. The only way to destroy it is to let it re-posses a Catholic nun. When the hero does so, he turns into a mirror image of himself. Or something."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Director Gilliat fashioned this atmospheric, intelligent murder mystery, beautifully restored and available for the first time via the Criterion Collection. ""Green"" maintains foreboding throughout, leavened by the superlative Sim's dry wit. Though his on-screen entrance occurs well into the film, Sim's Cockrill, a fearless detective who becomes terrified at the sound of buzz-bombs, still dominates the proceedings through his methodical paces to uncover the whys and wherefores of the case-and nab a murderer."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Great DVD set for a great story.  Just started rematching it!
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I was shocked and appaIlled at the terrible story of the the evil son of the equally evil Saddam . The movie is a glimpse into the life of a man whose complete lack of moral conscience and humanity allowed him to do anything he desired without fear of retribution. The double, however, is a man who is appalled at the atrocities he's forced to witness and takes a daring step to get some justice for the lives Saddam's son destroyed. If you were as unaware of this story as I was, it will enlighten and perhaps enrage you but you will not fail to be moved!"
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,Enjoyed the Venetian scenery.  The movie was eerie and has a rather shocking ending.  It was great to see Sutherland and Christie  in their hey day.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,This  is NOT a favorite Elvis picture. His character was too irresponsible. Blue Hawaii is a much better movie. I got the feeling that Hawaiian tourism was the goal here.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Bought to watch with my son. no issues mailed to me fast every part of this went well :) great
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Okay the story is good, the animation great, the fan service in a way minimal, and you won't be screaming at the TV because characters are acting a typical manner that makes you frustrated with poor character development or weak writting.

This is a must have in any anime collection, but I would defently recomend buying it at around $24 dollars."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,These movies are great and hold ones attention showing the greatness of Kojak and how he works.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"We've all heard the premise before, we all know how it's going to end, but few films take us on such an marvelously silly ride as 'The Other Guys'! This film is played completely for laughs and at no point do you think anything happening is real. It's funny as the only film that came to mind when I watched this movie was Steve Coogan's 'Hamlet 2'(even more hilarious!), which is a different story, but has the same loopy feel. Coogan has a fairly small but intricate role here, but I suspect he helped with the humor or they chose him to be in this because he had the right amount of kookiness they were looking for.

Ferrell has never been funnier and Walberg proves he can do comedy in this farce with a mission to bust your gut! I laughed out loud throughout this crazy flick and it was a welcome change from the standard buddy film. If you're in the mood for supreme goofiness, then 'The Other Guy' will have you laughing hysterically, but if you don't like silly films, then this one might leave you scratching your head."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"OK show,  lead singer voice is past it's prime but worth watching. Aduio and picture are pretty good and the set list is good."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"An entertaining look at the excesses of the eighties: greed, corruption, hubrisit's all there portrayed by some of today's most versatile actors. Christian Bale as an under the radar conman content with the small con being hustled by an overambitious FBI agent (Bradley Cooper), and Bale's partner in crime Amy Adams blurring their relationship with her own agenda. Mix with the political machinations of Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence as Bales mercurial wife, and it's a roller coaster ride full of punches and counterpunches with many laughs along the way. A fun ride and deserving of Oscar nominations."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Fast paced and held your interest to the very end.  Violent with a comedic touch, if you can imagine that.  Great acting.  Can't go wrong with Clive Owen.  Paul Giamatti was a bit off the wall in his mobster roll, always receiving calls from his wife while conducting 'business' as usual.  Monica Balducci was teamed well with Clive Owen."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Love all The Last of the Summer Wine. I really do enjoy them. Wish they could have gone on even longer.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Great movie, really good quality of the video. I got in time and the packaging is nice. Really good buy except that the movies are stacked together instead of in it's own dvd section."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"There's 14 of these now so people should know that THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL ANIMATION.  If you go in expecting the 90's X-men cartoon you will be very disappointed.  This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Anyway let's see some more.  Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, who is next?"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,Good movie...no where near being the best of the franchise but still good. I was expecting more ....
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I ran accross this one by suprise at the store, and Being a carlin fan, it was a no brainer.  Carlin has many great HBO specials over the years, but this one definitly is getting towards probably one of is last.  Carlin unfortunately really is starting to show his age, but his opening rant was great.  But from their the jokes were ok, solid for a few good laughs and moments, but not as memorable as many of his past performaces, and nothing that will stick like them either. HE has so much work, at some point you expect a bit of a let off.  But, it was good to see him out still doing it. Although his political correctness is probably the worst ever, what do you expect, it's Carlin.  Check it out, worth watching, especially if you are doing a Carlin marathon..this one is more like a warm up act, then break out some of his classics and you have a funny evening with a great comic legend of our day."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The Jeffersons is one of the funniest shows ever made. I bought the Complete First Season from Amazon.com a few weeks ago, and I just love it. I hope that the other ten seasons are released on DVD. If you havne't seen the Jeffersons yet, then I suggest watching it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,I learn a lot from Jimmy Bruno cd's.
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,grsiny picture and dissapointed that cut it in half from the original version! why? don't waste your money!
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"1, 2, & 3 were far better.
The thing is that ""Hunter"" is introduced here but to the little boy, as a neighbour.
The scenes do keep you at the edge of your seat, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - but it was not as gripping as the first 3!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"A mediocre movie.  The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together.  I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.

I'm content to own a copy, because it was the only Bond I didn't already have, but I don't know whether I'll ever bother to watch it again."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"First of all I am a huge Clint Mansell fan and it's no wonder he developed a cult following after this soundtrack. It is amazing and makes the movie that much more impactful. This film just goes to show the power music has over a film. That aside the film itself is a completely sensorial experience. Watching the progression and destruction of these characters you feel as if you yourself are the addict and as the brilliance in shot composition deteriorates so does the characters and audience members along the way. You feel and see what the feel and see and you feel the hunger and desperation for their chosen vice. A beautifully heartbreaking portrayal of addiction and destruction that left me completely engrossed, repelled, and sucked dry of all emotion by the end of the rollercoaster of a film."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This review is aimed solely at The Curse as I bought the double feature just for that movie.  I saw this movie as a child and seeing it again after all these years, I am quite surprised at how frightful it was despite being an obvious low budget movie with rather poor acting.  Despite the obvious, you get sucked into the movie and it with this that I give it a high satisfactory rating and will love to watch it again.  As for the curse 2...I haven't seen it but it doesn't interest me either."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Sure there are a few flaws, but overall this is a must own wwe dvd set.  The main flaw is that their is very little shown of Shawn Michaels time with D-X.  But when you consider how long his career has been (Which makes me feel very old), the you know WWE did the best they could with this set.  Just wish they had made it larger and included more footage of Shawn Michaels with D_X. They were my favorite tag team in the WWE period."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I liked getting an American based movie and that they changed some of the terms such as Muggle to No-mag (spelling?) because that is true to the culture, America may be the offspring of Britain and we may all speak English but we still change things to make it our own lift vs elevator for example.

It definitely had a different feel than the previous HP movies, darker, older, more mature. But it's still neat to see the origins of some of the HP lore"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I don't give out five stars often, but this movie merits 5 at least.
My degree in history came in handy for this film.  With attention to detail, the film is not only breathtaking in scope, scenery, and impact, it is a living history wherein you can see a slice of 18th century life.
The film is another rendition of James Fennimore Cooper's famous tome.  However, it's 100x better than the old Hollywood film of the same name.  This one is nuanced, showing the motivation of the French as well as the English, the nature of the Indians fighting for each side (i.e. the French-Indian War), as well as the colonists (i.e. us) who are cast adrift by an English parent country itself under siege by the powerful French regime opposing them in every (war) theatre.

The movie covers the daughters of the English commanding officer in the area and their struggle to survive in an incredibly hostile wilderness, beset by the French&their Indian allies, and the spectre of being alone.  Somehow, some of the heroes survive while others do not.

The cinemetography, musical score, and fine screenplay just seal the deal; a must-have film..."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Corky Romano is a movie that is funny, silly ,and disgusting. Once I saw this movie, I couldn't stop laughing. I really liked the part where he had to translate words in languages such as Vietnamese and Thai. I also liked the part where he talked to a group of second graders on being an agent. If you like to joke around or be funny, Corky Romano is the right movie for you. The movie is about the Romano family being betrayed by a hidden FBI informent,so they decide to send a family member to erase all of the evidence. They had to send Corky Romano(Chris Katten) because he's the only family member that the FBI won't recognize. Corky's silly attitude accidentally made him becomes a star after going undercover. I give Corky Romano 5 siily stars."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,I enjoyed this movie the acting was pretty good and so was the story.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Even though I'm not a Cruise fan, he does know how to make an entertaining action flick.  There was action, humor, diversity, and he surprisingly has a knack of presenting up and coming new performers (Rosamund Pike, David Oyelowo and Jai Courtney).  I don't like the person but the actor that is Tom Cruise is surprisingly good."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Loved the movie, but it left a bad (director (Besson), and so called visual effects) after taste.
The first BIG downer, was when Lucy was repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czars henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drugs where inside her belly; REALLY?  The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore. REALLY?
I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?
Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production.
Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it was a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I saw this movie with my children today and on a scale from 1-10 I give it a ZERO. There is one character who broke out of jail and came back
to get some ""parchment with a magical message""  which he believed he deserved to receive.  In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is  ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED  MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM. THINK TEN TIMES BEFORE LETTING YOUR CHILDREN SEE THIS MOVIE."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Reminds me of this one time at camp as a kid.....There were all these lights and these little guys in silver suits. That's all I can remember. But it's like that but better.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,It brought back memories form when I first saw it with my daughters . am looking forward to sharing it with my grand children.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I saw the preview of this movie on YouTube and was immediately intrigued. I had seen movies like ""A Thief in the Night,"" and those that followed it, but had never seen one of this caliber before. The acting was Hollywood-esque, the storyline captivating, and overall production was top notch. Additionally, if I had not already been a Christian, this would've pushed me over the edge into becoming one. The movie focuses on what would happen if Jesus came back to receive his church on a Sunday morning, and involves several people that you figured would've known better to make sure that they were ready. If you like end-of-the-world drama that is subtle, yet substantial, this one is for you!!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,These movies are favorites & a great package deal.  Inspirational & very touching stories for Christmas.
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"This movie made me hate this character. What a terrible sequel, with gawdawful writing. I seriously despise Liam's psychotic character now, who was so wonderful in the first film."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Loved this musical...I've always been intrigued by children's voices, having directed their plays and choirs.  I continue to follow Jean-Baptiste Maunier's career."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"i enjoyed this movie because it mentions what the planet is like and how the author creates the solutions to problems coming up,"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Wonderful comedy! Excellent acting and writing. I can't wait for season 2.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This review is for the Blu Ray version of Anastasia.  Regrettably, there is not a DVD version included, but the Blu Ray is high quality with a few fun extra features (a couple of games, a drawing Anastasia tutorial, etc.)

All in all, a good buy, as long as the price stays low.

It is a great animated movie, but I won't give the movie a full review since most folks looking to buy the Blu Ray already have seen and love the movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the movies that you I can watch over and over again.  I ordered it because my husband and I collect movies and we simply realized we did not have this one.  Which is a mistake.  If you like silly comedies (like Tommy Boy, Dumb & Dumber, ect) then this movie is for you!"
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,Not very good. It sounds okay but not great choice of songs. Also it's made from photographs not film so not real footage.
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I'm sorry, what are we teaching our kids?  That police corruption is the way to solve tough cases?  Sorry, no thanks."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I got this originally because I was into the Lorelei's Grasp based on reviews I read. I'd never seen a Naschy go this way or that way, and ended up watching Horror rises from the Tomb first and really dug it. If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror films from the 70s based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film looks great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fans - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scenes where he gets to paw his actresses' naked breasts every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you?

Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babes at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girls like idiots and send them back to their rooms, then shake their heads in disbelief when they're murdered two minutes later... ""we did all we could"". Some people like movies where cops are staking out a school being attacked nightly by a monster, and then one of the girls complains there's breathing in her room and the cops just think she's imagining it and then act surprised an hour later when she's dead -- oh those hysterical women! At least that's how I remember it. You get the idea though. Eventually there's a twisted dark reflection of THE LITTLE MERMAID's trans-species / terrain love affair and a cool underwater cavern lair."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,There was so much going on it was very difficult to follow.  The language by the characters was very offensive - every sentence contained a vulgar language.  Not a series I would recommend.  We stopped play about 20 minutes into the first episode.
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.  As for us, while we appreciate the Tim Burton like darkness, the story was too bizarre and too violent for us and the kids had us turn it off after the second over the top song, really wish we hadn't purchased thisif you are not sure, may want to rent."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Better than the second film of the series.  Some deviation from the book, but not as jarring as the changes in ""Desolation of Smaug"".  Tie ins to LOTR were done well without hurting the original story."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,This 3rd film in the Hobbit saga is again a bit long and too full of action to bring emotions to the table as some scenes seem more like a video game and Peter Jackson seems to be playing more than making a movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This movie has it all - amazing special effects, amazing story and the actors are great as well.  Joss Whedon had a very tall order when he set out to direct / write this movie - but he pulled it off and it went on to become one of the top grossing movies of all time.  I've watched it many times and it is still wonderful to see it over and over again.  Definitely worth adding this to your movie collection - looking forward to seeing the new one in a couple of months."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"If ever there was a an outstanding family video this is it, it captivates and entertains and tugs as all the right heart strings."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This movie is not that bad. For an abandoned mine story I think they did pretty well and found myself to be mildly entertained all the way through. Its a typical story, well done. This movie definitely deserves a better rating than most people are giving it."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"The above line spoken by Oscar winner Hilary Swank is indicative of the dialog in this special effects driven sci-fi saga. Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.
Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's ""studly"" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.
The film is passable entertainment.
I just kept waiting for the discovery of an underground ""civilization"" that might have been responsible for all the above ground havoc."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I wish I were eloquent enough to convey just how much I loved and apprecciated the feelings this movie evoked in me when I watched it the first time.  Each dream or vignette is distinct and yet somehow connected.  My favorite was the 'peach orchard' segment.  It was so stunningly beautiful it brought me to tears.  The colors were unparalleled and the message was clearly yet sensitively conveyed.  It is not a movie with the traditional beginning, middle and end.  It is separate 'dream' sequences that fit together in an unusual but highly effective way. I love all of Kurosawa's movies, but this is a special piece I will hold in my heart forever."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the MOST superb and enigmatic titles of the Noir Film in any age. After being twenty long years in prison, Victor Mature must infiltrate gang run by the psychopath Richard Widmark who simply ignites the screen with his mercurial performance This is the famous film that offers the brutal and merciless sequence in which gleefully pushes a wheelchair-bound. woman to her death downstairs.

This is to my mind the glorious contribution of Henry Hathaway in this genre."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I realize this series is old news now but I only recently discovered it.  I LOVE IT!  Funny, sassy, thought-provoking, sexy - what more do you need?  I bought the 5-season collection and am thoroughly enjoying it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Not bad for a 1955 movie. Who is ""good"" and who is ""bad""? An adventure in the jungle that changes some personalities and ends with some surprising survivors."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"""It's just a box."" So you get a box and are offered a million dollars to push the button. But someone will die. Is that really any different than someone handing you a gun and offering you a million dollars for a hit? Why are they even sitting around saying, ""should we push it?"". With a gun there would be no question. But take away the name and face of the victim, and all of a sudden, ""it's just a box."" That was the one thing that really baffled me. Did they really think there would be no consequences to their actions?

No, I take it back. That was not the only thing that baffled me. The entire second half of the movie baffled me. I will still give it 3 stars because it held my attention throughout, but once they introduced the extraterrestrial element, they lost me. I've watched the movie twice now and I just do not understand it. I was feeling pretty stupid until I read some other reviews and found that it didn't make sense to most people who saw it...even the people who loved it!"
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Family-oriented comedy ""Zoom"" has the right cast. Tim Allen is a retired, washed-up ex-superhero who is given a mission to train a group of misfit kids with special ability. The trainees are played by Spencer Breslin, Kate Mara, Michael Cassidy and Ryan Newman. The film also has decent production designs, and is supported by the veterans like Rip Torn and Chevy Chase. So far, everything is great. Well, it might not be great exactly, but you can at least expect a decent family picture like ""Sky High.""

However, the film is helmed by a wrong director, Peter Hewitt, whose previous works include first ""Garfield"" movie and ""Thunderpants"" (just in case you haven't seen it, the latter is a one-joke film about a farting boy). For all the charms and the talent of the cast, and the characters' likable nature, those would-be superheroes/heroines becoming transparent or making the body and limbs bigger like rubber ball, have already been done in ""The Incredibles"" or other films of the same genre. With some wit or twists added, those characters would have been more interesting. As it is, they remain just OK with the lazy direction and very familiar sight gags.

The film's weak script, which does not explain convincingly why these kids must be brought together and trained like this, is already a problem. But the saddest thing is, for me, watching Chevy Chase covered with greenish sticky slime coming out of a boy's nose. It's a worse kind of gag than pie-throwing.

I like Tim Allen, but it makes me sad to see his recent films like this and ""The Shaggy Dog."" The film is not as bad as the very low user rating of IMDb suggests and the father-daughter-like relations between him and Ryan Newman is credible, but except that (and cute Ryan Newman) I cannot think of the reason why this film had to be made."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I need to select different scenes to show; for a college class that I teach- I was STUNNED to discover neither of these discs HAS a menu! I'm really upset. I have to see if I can return them, as they are NOT gonna work for me."

Even if your not a disney fan, nor did u ever watched Snow White this series  is great for old, young, or non disney fans."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Them is an old movie. I like watching James whitmore
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Three Days of the Condor and  Sneakers gave us an early preview of what we're reading in the headlines. These films would make a great double feature in the family room for adults.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Fun, intelligent, fascinating historical drama. In a class by itself in a world of ""so much the same"" contemporary crime dramas!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This film may not touch of the Anecdote you are searching for -
because there are so many health conscious folks out there already doing this.  Check out Kris Carr - Crazy Sexy Cancer and various other programs.
If you need tools...find those who provide that - and one that works for You, not your family, not your friends...YOU!

What I liked about this film is that AFFIRMS the truth of what real health is all about - Taking responsibility of Your Body, Feeding it the foods that nurture and sustain, and Just Do IT.  If you need a boost in the right direction - watch this.  And then begin Your Journey."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.  For me, a thread of unbelievability runs throughout the movie, which could easily have been fixed had the producers hired a genuine SST astronaut as an advisor to the script."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,I can watch this on repeat all day long.  I love the Bluths!  Definitely worth every single penny I paid for season 3
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,I like the series. I liked being pulled into a show and forget about the world.  Watch fantasy a bit and its pretty cool.  Story was fun.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,Classic film! My Grandmothers favorite now one of mine! Came quick and packed well!
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Paul G. Is great in this wonderful story about a man who was a true patriot of impeccable integrity.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This was a beautifully crafted movie, gritty, suspenseful, well written and wonderfully acted. It told a nice detective yarn with real characters, well developed characters. There was enough grime and blood to be titillating but not in my opinion over the top. The pacing was just right; It flowed beautifully right down to the wonderfully done pull at the close of the last scene. It was almost really good. But the script pulled me out of it too many times. The dialog occasionally felt like it had been pulled right out of a novel without nearly enough of the back story you would find in the novel to justify it. I imagine it would feel okay to someone who had read the novel but in the movie it was sometimes insufficient to suspend belief. That being said I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. I would watch another with this character."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,the girl was hilarious and the personality was eventful getting to watch these charicters interact in this situation was hilarious but totally what a mess with a point
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I wholeheartedly agree with those who've said that the DVD is of poor quality. In fact, it's awful quality and spoils the enjoyment of an otherwise really good comedy/mystery type. It's a fun picture to watch. Too bad it wasn't digitally re-mastered."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,It is a great DVD full of archeological finds & information. A bit long though.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,an essential must have in the library of any Dodger or baseball fan. awealthofknowledge about the franchise's early years and why they were such a beloved community treasure in Brooklyn.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I am a HUGE Sopranos fan. I have all the seasons except this one...While I did like this season, it was kinda disappointing to me. I have heard all the arguments about the end or whatever, but I just thought the whole thing was too rushed. They tried to throw too many new people and things at you. If anything, I would have wanted them to make two more seasons.
This season was very dark and depressing, but it was good. Bittersweet.
 The end was just that, THE END. You can choose anyway you want to decide what happens to the fam."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Exellent acting/performances by the leads.  I'm definitely hooked on the story line too!
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I'm shocked that more people don't know about it, and even more shocked that it never received a proper DVD release.  This movie is hilarious -- definitely a ""Spinal Tap"" for country music....but it's not a rip-off of Spinal Tap.  Even if you aren't a fan of Country music, you should see this movie...it's funny and has a cast of some great actors/actresses.  I hope that this film someday sees the light of day (i.e. major distribution).  It was originally only available as a rental (or as a purchase on VHS) from Blockbuster.  But it's so much better than that.  In Summary:  A great parody that I can watch again and again."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This disk is one of my favorites. Although not quite up to the standards of it's two predecessors, the Third Dr. Mabuse film (and the last directed by Lang himself) is wonderful and more than worth the purchase price.
David Kalat's extraordinary commentary is easily THE BEST I have ever heard (and I've heard quite a few.) He strikes the perfect balance between knowledge and wit - the narration is informative without being dry or condescending and, indeed, is quite lively at times. His delivery style is remarkably excellent throughout and is a major reason I consider the disk to be one of my most valued.
Two tiny quibbles, stuff so small as to bother only me: The English Language captioning, written for the German audio track, is a little disorienting when viewed in connection with the English language track. Most of this has to do with the demands of lip-synchronization between two languages. Still, and despite the additional cost it might have created, two independent sets of captions would have been appreciated - one for each of the different languages. This would be a welcome addition for a hearing impared viewer.
The other minor quibble is that the documentary really needed captioning, much more so than the feature owing to the heavy accented speech.
All told, though, this is absolutely a remarkable film and a remarkable, and very treasured disk. AllDay Entertainment is releasing some extraordinary stuff, and deserve kudos and, above all, purchases!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Glad to finally replace the DVD version I had that never looked better then my original VHS! I have yet to watch it, its not close enough to Christmas yet!"

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I am 1 hr 44 mins into this film and had been continuously bored by this complete mess of a big budgeted war film.
Spike Lee should have done better homework before he launched his attempt to recount black soldiers heroics
during WWII.  At lease he could have cut 40 mins out of this 160 mins film.  For more details, refer to the other
negative reviews."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Hapless, accident-prone Keitaro becomes janitor of a dorm populated by a quintet of stunningly beautiful, but dangerously abusive women -- one of which may turn out to be his secret sweetheart who he apparently promised would attend Tokyo U fifteen years ago. The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in."

This is the complete 'Scooby-Doo Show' list.  This DVD set is NOT the complete third season it is the complete seventh season.  As much as it pains me to do so I must give this inaccurate Scooby Set one star.  Come on Hanna-Barbara please do the Scooby DVD's right."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,I saw this on TV and decided to get it to show the family every Thanksgiving.  It has great acting and it is very realistic in it's approach to the journey to America.  I will show it at school as well.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I've read them all.  I've reread them all.  And I'll read them all again.  This series pulls the best of characters and plots from Stout's books, couples them with fine ensemble acting and beautiful music.  So, I've watched, watched again, and will watch some more."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Hilarious.  Differs from book but still fun and funny...recommended.
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,I saw this movie in the theatres limited run for Academy qualifications.  Expected much for disappointed as I could not get an emotional attachment when emotion was vital to the storyline.  Also it's hard for non-Japanese to understand the ghost world myths so that may have something to do with it.
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,Absurd plot loaded with unbelievable coincidences but numerous humorous moments. Hard to know if the director was trying to make a crime drama or a comic  movie about criminals involving a bundle of stock characters. When will they ever learn about the stupidity of the sideways-held handgun?
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Good series, just extremely low volume during speaking parts. It's like the director was afraid that the actors did not know their lines. A little disappointed because I really like Peter Davison."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Have seen this movie twice already- once with my folks and once solo. The only compliant I had once it finished was the vulgarity- the movie honestly didn't need it and had it not had it, it would have survived just fine. Yes, this film is fantastic, one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. We have it on blank DVD already that my father transferred over but I think I might purchase this myself just to enjoy it again whenever I want, it's that good. Great script, story, cast and laugh out loud moments. You cant beat it."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"My husband liked it, but I was bored. It didn't really hold my interest. I also felt like the ending could have been wrapped up better."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,Highly recommend Midsomer Murders if you like mysteries.  We have all of them and enjoy them often.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered the season and watched every episode back to back as soon as it became available. Epic! This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days. With any luck, there will be many more seasons to come."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"There aren't many movies I watch over and over, but this is one. There is no sexual misconduct, no one gets hurt, and all the good guys and gals get a happily-ever-after.

When I feel frustrated because my dreams feel out of reach, this is a feel-good movie that helps me feel better."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"THis was my FAVORITE show as a kid so I was thrilled when they released the first season on dvd. I never get tired of watching this show, I loved the extras with commentary and the special or whatever you call it on the one disc, I was a little disappointed that there were not more extras cause I like the extras on the dvds. Seeing what Lynda Carter looks like today was really neat and to hear her talk about her experience on Wonder Woman was a treat. Get this dvd if your a fan of this show-you'll be glad you did!"
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Knowing that this set comes edited and not as originally aired, I had put off purchasing it for years. When the price dropped below $30, I decided to give it shot. I'm glad I did. As a casual fan, I haven't really been bothered by the edits or changes. Season 1-3 seem to be mostly intact. Seasons 4 and 5 are where I noticed some differences. If you're a purist or die-hard fan, I understand why you wouldn't purchase this set though. For the casual fan, I think it's well worth the price. The transfer to DVD looks good. The set also comes with some nice extra features such as commentary from Gary Marshall, interviews, and more. The only other negative besides the edits is that the packaging is quite poor. The plastic case is thin and flimsy. The disks are easily dislodged. All around, I give this set 4 Stars. Casual fans will really enjoy it, but purists might be disappointed."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I won't add anything about the movie itself, but will comment on the commentary by Anthony R Santoro.  I have been reading about Prussia and Germany for many years and just finished ""The Iron Kingdom"" by Christopher Clark.  It is an excellent book about the history of Prussia from 1600 to 1947.  After finishing the book and then listening to the commentary by Santoro, I am shocked by the total inaccuracy of his commentary.  It was like returning to the1940 USA propoganda about Germany.
Great movie but almost everything about the commentary (which must be turned on) is a fiction.
Germany before and during WWII was not a cartoon character, and serious study must be undertaken to understand Prussia and Germany.  If USA citizens knew the history of the German States their attitude towards Germany would change dramatically.

The USA is blessed to not be bordered by more powerful countries; Germany historically was dominated by Russia, France, GB and Austria.  These countries ran roughshod over Germany for hundreds of years and Prussia and the rest of the German States lived in fear of the more powerful countries."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Although this movie has a far bigger ambition than budget, it still manageed to delight and entertain me throughout all of its 89 minutes.  It's by far the best movie THE ASYLUM has produced yet and while it certainly isn't up to the production standards of big budget hollywood stuff, it is often far more entertaining than the overblown hype Michael Bay and his ilk come up with.  Honestly, the movie has a very striking, almost psychodelic look with loads of wild, garish lighting and lurid color schemes.  The editing is fast and frantic and the visual effects are occasionally almost passable.  The acting is over the top (and lots of fun) and the script is really out there.  I  truly enjoyed and appreciated this thing a lot. The DVD transfer is especially excellent and on an upconverting DVD player it often approaches bluray picture quality.  The super aggressive Dolby 5.1 surround sound will also give your subwoofer a real workout (although dialog is sometimes a bit distorted). Plenty of surround effects as well for an emersive experience. The premise of this one is so goofy and it moves along with a giddy speed that kept me smiling from start to finish.  I loved it."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"""Batman Begins"" is impressive! Christian Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne / Batman. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman led a solid supporting cast that has Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, and Ken Watanabe in it. Christopher Nolan's directing is impressive. The screenplay by Nolan and David S. Goyer (who also wrote the Blade Movies) and the story by Goyer is brilliant. The music by James Newton Howard & Hans Zimmer is very impressive. The cinematography (Oscar nominated) by Wally Pfister is excellent. The film editing by Lee Smith is excellent. The casting by John Papsidera & Lucinda Syson is excellent. The production design by Nathan Crowley is very impressive. The art direction by Peter Francis, Stuart Kearns, Paul Kirby, Simon Lamont, Steven Lawrence, David Lee, Patrick Lumb, Shane Valentino, Su Whitaker is very impressive. The set decoration by Paki Smith is very impressive. The costume design by Lindy Hemming is very impressive. This is one of the year's best and one of the best comic book movies in recent history since ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004)."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Released in 1969. Everyone who had anything to do with this film is now either deceased or long out of the movie business. Who got paid for digging ""The Witchmaker"" out of the landfill almost fifty years later?  Is there a living to be made exhuming mediocrity when there's so much fresh mediocrity still above ground?  I suppose images depicting the degradation, abuse, or slaughter of young women will always appeal to enough people to make supplying them a viable business."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"We love this movie better than the original Wizard of Oz, not that the original was bad. Just we love this rebooted version more.

It is a dip into sci-fi and fantasy, a bit darker direction as well. But it was great!

I am certain most younger generation will love this movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Great story. B&W, full screen, monophonic sound...BUT I never tire watching this. Great moral lesson. Those who you THINK are your friends may not be there for you when you really need them."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"It's hard to classify this movie. I guess it's a ""drama"", but nothing particularly dramatic happens. Mainly it's a chance to watch the interplay of personalities, mainly between the father and the two brothers.
Oh, and there's some really pretty scenery and some fancy fishing.
To enjoy this movie, you have to be prepared to sit back, relax, and be receptive to a slow unfolding of the story's subleties. A little bit like the way people enjoy fishing, come to think of it.
The DVD version is great for maximizing the scenic aspect of the movie - this really requires the wide-screen format. Not too much in the way of bonus materials, though."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The video of Murder She Wrote, the complete 11th series is is wonderful and a quality product. I will purchase from this seller again any time I need something that they are selling. The product is of a high quality."

We were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen & our love for animated movies...

This movie will NOT disappoint you! It was an absolute GEM of a movie!!!
Although we saw it in 2d, it was visually STIMULATING, with STUNNING effects, action sequences & characters!!!
All the characters, scenery, and animation were Simply AMAZING!!!
Not too mention the voices of all the characters were a perfect fit & each voice over was clear and accurately defined!

Now for the story...
It was a well written story with built in Humor, loyalty, friendship and love!
A story that kids of all ages & adults could follow & believe in!

There is something in this movie for Everyone that watches it:)

If you have children, take them to see this movie ASAP... it is the perfect time of year, and will add to the Holiday Spirit...
If your child, ask your Parent or Parents to take you to this movie...
If your an adult, go see this movie... it will most likely bring back fond memories and you will leave the theater fulfilled!!!

I give this movie an A+

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Plot - Rotten Tomatoes
A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;)."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"It is mostly in English, but when they speak Spanish - English subtitles appear, so it is all good."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,I found it entertaining and would probably watch it again. I thought Al's character was pretty funny. I just wished it would o ended different.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,I had to watch this episode for one of my master's classes and it was my first foray into Mad Men.  I liked it and ended up watching seasons 1-3 via Netflix.  The quality was good but my computer had to keep rebuffering it based on the speed.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,I love the story I love the action I love the Captain America cameo very good movie 5 out of 5
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Very easy to follow, not too hard but got my body moving.  I have been using it all week so far and look forward to it.  It's amazing how moving around a little more than often can have a big effect.  Nice DVD."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,I chose this ratings because it was a catch up and final season after the Writer's Strike.  Mrs Keaton couldn't stop Alex from leaving home after graduation.  It wouldn't work.
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"hte fact that some parts of this movie may have a taste of surrealism to it (flesh eating bacteria,racist rednecks,mad dogs and those ever pesky horny teenagers) doesn't mean that cabin fever is a valid  horror flick. the actors are lame (WTF kinda name is rider strong anyway? sounds like a name for a porno star like boogie night's dirk diggler. ha ha)the story stole from so many horror movies, cliche's etc. and to top it all off what's up with the lame ass shopkeeper scene?? the near ending with the ""n"" word was done in piss poor taste. sure you have your garden variety racist @$$hole rednecks, but the ""payoff"" was meant to be humorous, but it wasn't, and who's the idiot that wrote the dennis/pancakes scene?!?  a karate kicking,androdgenous redneck kid who bites people? the gore was gratuatious but the specail makeup effects deserve praise. and to see the two actors from a good film like detriot rock city, have hit rock bottom when they signed on for this movie.
here's a slice of advice; rent a good horror film like freddy vs jason or underworld. pass on the indie horror flicks, especially anything from lion's gate who released crap like; house of 1000 corpses,May and this trash cabin fever. although ginger snaps was pretty good. and get this..lions gate has accquired ARTISAN, the guys that realeased the god awful HOUSE OF THE DEAD..oh boy."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?

One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.

This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!

The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  If you don't over-think it, you should enjoy also.  The antagonist is a truly twisted sociopath and we finally get a smart female lead.  She is not your typical lame damsel in distress, she takes it to the bad guy in this one.
There is a lot of good things here, there are also a lot of holes in the plot and some of this is really hard to believe, but like I said, it you suspense belief for a couple of hours it is a fun ride."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very pleasant workout DVD with variety, even though I'm not too keen on upbeat Christian music (thankfully you can't really tell that's what it is). The DVD packaging, however, advertises 5 cardio routines - as if you can choose from 5 different workouts, which isn't the case. It's actually 5 combinations (3-4 minutes each) that are then combined at the end to complete the 25-minute cardio portion. Overall it's not too challenging but the instructors are very pleasant and motivating."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"STORY: Glenn Ford stars as the rancher Smith, who is driving his family to frustration with his gentle procrastinating ways that have kept the farm from doing well. The hay needs to be cut, and he is distracted with his ongoing friendships with a local Nez Perce Native American tribe. When a tribal member is wrongly accused of murder, Smith comes to his defense. As a sign of the tribe's gratitude, they help train a horse from the ranch, and they help get the hay crop in on time.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Live action Disney classic. Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson, and Chief Dan George also star in this movie, and a good song written by Bobby Russell for the movie is featured, ""The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy"". While production was started initially by James Algar, Bill Anderson took over as producer fairly early. One of the studios greatest producers, Anderson saw the fim as a chance to appeal to a more mature audience that a typical Disney film, vital to Disney's growth. Directed by Michael O'Herlihy. The story had been adapted by studio staff storyman Louis Pelletier from a book by Paul St. Pierre titled, ""Breaking Smith's Quarter Horse"". This movie was released to theaters on March 21, 1969, and was released on video in 1987. It never featured on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show. It is 102 minutes in length.

Released almost two years after Walt's death, this film was almost unseen by the public since a top studio executive hated the film based on only a few scenes. He cut all funding for promotion of the film so there was no audience waiting to see it. Even a good review in the LA Times did not help bring the viewers in and it was out of theaters before the word of mouth could send in the crowds. I recommend this hidden little film from the Disney vault."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This movie is great. 'Nuff said. The DVD has some really interesting extras in it where they show you the castle it was shot at and which rooms all the scenes were in.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.

I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...

Please see my other review on Amazon of yoga and meditation dvds."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"It was an interesting movie to watch, I truly enjoyed it.  Nice plot, though it was sad so many people had to die."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Trs bonne qualit, rapport prix/$$$ excellent, je recommande ce produit."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,'REMEMBER' is superb filmmaking.  Christopher Plummer is remarkable and we are fortunate that he was cast in this film and in this role.  This movie is what great filmmaking is all about.  Great screenplay and direction.  Don't want to give away any of the plot because I feel it will give away too much and spoil the excitement of the film.  It's the best film I've seen in quite a long time.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"The stories have dated considering when they were made, the anecdotes by Alfred are fun to see."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, with director Michel Hazanavicius, did something entirely different here, completely unlike their award-winning work in The Artist. It's hard to believe this movie features the same three brilliant people.

Dujardin is brilliant at dumb-cluck-worthy mannerisms and quirks. Chasing bad guys down the back alleys of Cairo? You'd expect our hero, as heroes often do in their more suave and debonair incarnations, to run swiftly and with no uncertainty around corners, never slowing down or stopping. Not Agent 117...he has to stop completely, in a tense, crouching stance, in which he pivots, to look all directions, before he continues...not once, not twice, but at every single corner or intersection in the chase. I could go on and on, but I'm sure there are more wildly dumb and silly things going on than any could recount in one review."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This is an especially good young person's movie. It's an engaging, fun, and entertaining way to involve children in the basic philosophical issue of ontology. Ontology is the study of what it means to exist, or in the case of ""Short Circuit,"" what it means to be alive. Note Ren Descarte's (1596-1650) famous statement in Latin, ""Cogito, ergo sum."" (I think, therefore I am.)

Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray. One complicating factor is that much of ""Short Circuit"" was shot with low contrast, so inherently, its sharpness seems somewhat low."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

An interplanetary crew from Earth, answering a distress signal from another planet, land and get more than they bargained for. Very smart, underplayed and scary.

At times I felt I was watching an episode of a well done Star Trek entry.

Very well done. Worth the rental."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"This is a perfect example of CGI taking over.  It's obvious someone drew up a storyboard with a dozen action scenes and another dozen tense lines.  There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  This Lex Luthor is the weakest villain of all time...just incredibly bland and flat.  The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.  That's unforgiveable considering how many actors have now played Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent.  If either of them show up in some other form or fashion I would beg Hollywood to stop any and all references to their past.  It's becoming a xerox of a xerox."

When I'm done with school, I get home, shed my clothes like a snake, grab some more coffee and replay the same movie. I make my witnesses and I sleep happy. 10/10 would watch twice a day for the rest of my life."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"The Help is an amazing story - that was not told at all by the movie. They left out the SERIOUS dangers that these women faced. There was no character development with Minnie, Leroy, Stuart, Miss Celia... Very disappointing. Skeeter's mother was made out to be a good person with a good heart deep down in the movie, but the book shows what a terrible person she really is - which made Skeeter's decisions and life even more difficult.
I'm happy the book is getting so much press - but REALLY don't understand why the movie is."

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not really a problem. If you're going to use it for a lot of things, it's a good size for them.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the cord when opening the bag, it's a little too small for my small hands.

It's not thick like some other sheets I've seen. I've had it for over a year now and it's still holding up well. I've never had it break or have it fall apart. I also like the way it's folded and the fact that it has a flat bottom so it doesn't clog up the pillows. I've had it for about a month now and it's still holding up well.

I had a similar press before and it seemed to work well. I used it with a small square of paper towel in a coffee pot. This one seemed to work well for the purpose.

The only thing I wish I had known was that I would have had to use a plunger. I have a few of these on my counter tops that are very easy to press and have worked great for a few years.

The only thing I wish I had known was that I would have had to use a plunger. I have not had one to break on the counter top as this one does.

I would have preferred to have a plunger on my counter top.

My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose.

I would have preferred to have a slightly tighter handle.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Best & Respectfully--"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Love this! I have it in my motor home. We travel extensively and I am on a No Bottled Water kick. It is perfect to make sure we have good drinking water wherever we go.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I'm new to sourdough bread baking and new to the world of bread knives. My bread is super crusty on the bottom. Yes the knife is sharp. Yes it cuts very thin slices super straight and easily. However, when I get to the bottom of the slice I do have to saw a bit to get through it. The knife is flexible, and I'm not used to the feel of that, but it does a good job. It arrived quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"we like this little opener, real easy on my hands."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the peppercorns long before the pepper mill arrived."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This bacon cooking product is much more efficient than a previous, different style of bacon/microwave cooker. It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This has been a nice little grill for making family breakfast. I like that it is none stick and has the cooling boundary around it. Bacon takes a while to cook on it but pancakes and eggs are fast. Decent to clean, wish it was dish washer safe. Over all very happy with it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Does what it is suppose to do. Hot water in a flash
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"We use these on multi-sizes of mason jars for our 7 year old (larger jar) and our 4 year old (smaller jar) and they work perfectly. Although not entirely spill proof which is why I only gave it 4 stars, the kids are neat enough to not create spills. I could see that being a problem for other kids however. Even with that, I would buy again and recommend as a good purchase for anyone looking for drinking covers for mason jars, which for us is our favorite cup for the kids. We haven't really used the straws but I do like them and they are durable to last a while. When we use them I will update this review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I like it but it's too big for most garbage bags. I have to use an oversized bag for a liner. As in other reviews, it came dented. How can the company keep shipping these without putting them in a decent box?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,i love the con-tact brand lite tack light adhesive shelf liner. easy to install and easy to remove with no residue.  The regular contact is difficult to remove and leaves an adhesive mark on the shelf.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This product is sturdy and has a nice design.  Will last and last.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Mirrors arrived in perfect condition. The beveled edge is a nice touch. Will look perfect for under my centerpieces at my wedding.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Eliminates big bulky dressers, thank goodness.  I was able to trash my big ugly wooden dresser, at last.  Great stuff, high quality, have owned mine for almost a year now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased a set of the Hamton Stovetop spoon stand for dinning room. The stand is designed well. The stand and dishes are good weight and very stable. Spoons rest on the dish and stand very balanced. The dishes have good depth and good size to hold the drippings. Dishes are also good quality and wash well in the dishwasher. I use these with my white/light colored serving and plates. Like it so much that I ordered another set for the kitchen counter.

I also own stainless spoon dish/stand set for over 10 years without any rust. That's one thing I can not yet rate because I haven't owned these long enough to know if they will rust or not. But I can tell the plate on this stand is not as good as my old stainless set. So I don't wash the stand in the dishwasher, and I don't soak the stand. Usually a quick wash and wipe to clean them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"As a glass French press user for decades, when I banged the Vonshef against the counter the first time I used it and it didn't break, I rejoiced!

Even more wonderful - it makes coffee just as good as my glass French press, keeps the coffee hotter during its 4-minute brew, and pours more easily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Absolutely love the quality, color and price. The cat seems to have taken to it so I bought a matching cat bed from Amazon for the kitty."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"If you own other Shun's you know this is going to an awesome product.  I have a fairly heavy cleaver that I use mainly for breaking through bones and connecting joints, but this beauty takes all the work out of slicing through whole celery bunches to evenly julienning ginger.  Definitely a must use tool in my knife arsenal"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Does what it's supposed to, I guess. It is a little too wide of an opening for our skinny fake tree, which looks a little odd-I can arrange it so it fits better though. If we ever decide to get a real (thicker) tree it'll work out better. It isn't the best tree skirt but it isn't the worst. The characters are cute. The material is a heavier felt. I don't buy anything expensive because I have a 3 year old who is the destroyer of all nice things. This isn't going to be advertised on the cover of Martha Stewart living's tree skirt of the season, but if you just need something cheap quick this should work fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Got this for measuring hot cocoa.. its the perfect size for a coffee cup... my kids can make there own
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Very cheap. The food gets stuck in the blade. You have to take it apart, get the food out, then try to chop again. Who wants to cut up good before they chop it? Doesn't work."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great pillow protector.  Well made and soft with no sound.  Have purchased these twice now and would purchase again!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These are great! Super cute. I was always forgetting to not screw the corkscrew all the way into the cork so it didn't have a hole all the way through it. Now I don't have to worry about it. You can see the size of them from my pictures. Also, picture 4 shows me tipping the wine (and there really is wine in that bottle) and nothing drips out, so it definitely works!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Same as a big stein I got while in college but plain and cheap. The only glass that weighs enough to hold the water dispenser on my fridge down so I can fill it without holding it myself. My old one has lasted almost 10 years (though it had printed/painted image on it and that scraped off slowly and is now completely gone). I prefer the plain one here, will be fun to etch later."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"A very versatile little device, letting you count up or down from seconds to hours.  Several folks at my office use these - eg, spending 15 minutes a day on filing, timing presentations, taking a nap at lunch time (seriously!), etc. I usually put it on buzzer and put it in my pocket - the alarm is a bit loud in the cubicle world."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"My son is all about racecars, and loves this toybox. It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the decorating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This works just as well as my old Kitchen-aid mixer did and it's not as cumbersome. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is it needs a bowl with a handle.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Con-Tact paper has come a long way since my early apartment years.  Ths is pretty forgiving stuff - you can always peel it up after you don't get it placed just so. I surprised myself by selecting this bold pattern for older white cabinets. It's actually kind of elegant. I didn't bother matching up the pattern. It really was not possible [for me]. But the seams are not at all noticeable. Great stuff, good price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This year will make the 3rd Halloween that I've given out treat bags using these and the kids love them.  They're colorful, fun, and durable at a low cost, and the size is perfect.  My order was received on time and in perfect condition.  I'll probably be back for more next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The DGB-600BC was recently purchased because my previous unit was 8 years old and was starting to leak.  I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement through the years.  The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is such a cute spoon rest.  When stirring my coffee, I was always laying the spoon on the counter.  Now I have this next to my coffeemaker so no more coffee spots on the counter.  I haven't tried using it for anything larger than a regular size table spoon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Takes a while to get enough for noodles but ok product. Your hand might be tired when done.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Nice quality. I bought this to be used with my Solo Campfire Stove.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Use these every day.  Convenient size and easy to clean.  Have 3 and love them.  Nice finish.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,I got these to hang in one of the bathrooms with the litter box to get rid of the litter box odor. Hung both of them in the bathroom but did not get rid of the litter box odor.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Kept coffee warm for hours. fits car cup holder nicely. DID NOT fit under the Keurig brewer.:(  I just brew into another cup and pour into the travel mug. I would buy again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Beautiful glasses!  I have been using plastic thermal glasses and they always get water in between the walls...and plastic just isn't the same as glass.  These glasses are very nice.  Smooth and thick and do not sweat.  I haven't put them in the dishwasher yet, so we'll see if they hold up.  They are a pricey, but if they hold up are really worth it.  Am going to buy a few more."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This exactly as advertised. I received mine in good shape, though it was a little bit bigger than I imagined.  It works perfectly, and arrived  without dings, scratches or plastic anywhere in the product. I did put some boos butcher block cream on it since it's going to be exposed on my counter.  It's a nice product for a good price.  The company also contacted me via email to make sure I was happy with it, with assurances that they will fix it if I'm not. I appreciated the followup."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Boy this gets hot fast. Love it to take in a motel room for instant coffee or hot chocolate .
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Another good stand.  I use it with whatever wax pottery vessel I display in the kitchen.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Sturdy hammer, great price. Projections of tenderizing face are rather shallow; may not penetrate meat enough to do the job. Handle is not as comfortable as I had hoped. I may wish to exchange the item for a different design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Gave them several tries. Made sure tile was clean, suction cups were clean, suction properly applied. No go. Cannot recommend. They're in the trash."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love to make custard in the cold months, and this is a nice matched set that work very well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought two for my new double stainless steel sink. They look great and are totally functional.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Much larger than expected. Almost excessive but I love the patterns and it looks wonderful in my room.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Nice. haven't totally unpacked it yet. is a gift. Styrofoam all over the place.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Works wonderfully. We have had for several months now and it is still going strong. I love the length of the cord it reaches much further. I love how much it picks up, very helpful since we deal with pet hair. Easy to empty and clean. Affordable and reliable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"They work fine now for 6 months, would give 5 stars but recipes are horrible."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Amazingly effective.  The rubber attachment acts like a curry brush and picks up a ton of fur from furniture.  The suction is great for a vacuum of this size.  The cord is very long so vacuuming large pieces of furniture and even carpets is convenient.  It is easy to empty and clean.  One star detracted because as other reviewers have noted, the placement of the vents does cause debris/fur to fly everywhere if you're not careful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the speedy delivery.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Makes the best cup of coffee I ever had at home. You are brewing the grounds through ss mesh, not plastic!??

!??"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,No way you can beat the price of this and it works great once you season it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Such an easy way to make baked potatoes!  I love this and use it regularly.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Nice glass cup!!! This cup would go well with my new kitchen, and new table~and I like tea in the glass cup because I can see the kind of landscape, goods to the Cup outside the kind of mood."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,Very small and flimsy looking bag. The product info on the webiste is somewhat unclear/misleading. Had to return it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Took off one star for easy to use because it is not the easiest to out back in the holder after you use it. Other than that, it is great!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Well made, as you can definitely feel it. The stainless steel feel and the rubber is great.
The cold and heat control maintainenance is great so far.

1 star off for the cap. The lock creates a great seal, BUT it is a pain to get it open. There is no way I can open this while driving with one hand.
I have the older contigo with the press and open. That was much more convenient.

Click help if this review helped."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love this product. I use the larger fan in my exercise room and get a wide reach and instant cooling. The price is well worth the quality of the device. The smaller fan is perfect for my office where my AC is not as powerful for some reason. Overall, highly recommended for its quality, cost and practical application."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Great water filter. My ice maker made more clear ice than I'd even had before.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Didn't mix the paint at all. maybe would have been good for a quart. but that's pointless.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Best cake pans on the market!  I now have a small collection of these pans in different sizes and they are fantastic!  They make a huge difference in the final  product.  Don't need to wrap the pans in baking strips because the pans are double insulated on all sides as well as the bottom, so everything bakes evenly.  I bake a lot including several wedding cakes and countless birthday cakes, everything homemade, and I swear by these pans.  Customer service is really great.  I had some a question and the customer service representative was so helpful and gave some great advice.  This company takes baking very seriously. Between the product, customer service, and the change they made to the sticky labels that come on the product (they come off much easier now), they have a devoted follower in me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Got these as a housewarming gift for a best friend who had moved into a house with 1 picture window and 3 oversized side windows.  These were such a deal (set of 2 panels) and was a neutral color that she had requested.  Okkkkk, let me say that the picture DOES NOT do these drapes justice.  They feel thicker and my hands kept caressing them; and the color is prettier in person that will compliment any primary color(s) you choose for your furniture and decor (FYI: the grommets are silver).  Not a true blackout but you definitely can't see through them.  My best friend ABSOLUTELY LOVED how they looked once we hung them up.  She purchased two - set of 6 curtain rod brackets from Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curtain-Rod-Brackets-Silver-Set-of-6-Brackets-Also-known-as-Curtain-rod-Holder-Bracket-for-Drapery-rod-Window-Drapery-rod-bracket-set-for-Draperies-adjustable-curtain-rod-brackets/dp/B071DT1GGL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curtain Rod Brackets - Silver (Set of 6 Brackets)(Also known as - Curtain rod Holder / Bracket for Drapery rod / Window Drapery rod bracket set for Draperies / adjustable curtain rod brackets)</a>&nbsp;.  We got three - 1/2 in. x 10 ft. steel conduit pipes (approx. $3.00 ea.), which I used a Dremel to cut down to size and two - 1/2 in. Electrical Metallic Tube (EMT) Set-Screw Connectors (pack of 5) to use as dowels and to keep the pipes from sliding off of the brackets for a total of $30.96 (total cost for all 4 windows) .  A decent heavy duty curtain rod will cost at least $20.00 for one window (not including the curtain rod bracket).
P.S.:  The curtain rod idea is just a FYI DIY for those looking to save a money and need a heavy duty curtain rod.  I use conduit pipes and copper (L) pipes as curtains rods for curtains with grommets throughout my house.
Sorry, I tried posting pictures but they appear sideways no matter if I change the settings of my picture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I received the canning jars in good shape.  They were well packaged with a lot of bubble wrap on the case.  No broken glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I cannot say enough about this blender. This is my second one (just wanted the updated version due to the extra blade and the more sealed up top) and I use it nearly daily for protein shakes. Convenient, easy clean up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Bought Chico bags and another variety (which looks like stuffed fruit when rolled up). Chico's material is thicker and more durable. It's easier to get products in and out of the Chico bags, and they hold a surprising amount of groceries an other items. Their compact design makes them easy to stash and have them around when you need them, in your pockets or vehicles. Easy to wash them, too. No more cheap ones for me. Also like the color variety."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"After my first night sleeping on a NeckBone pillow, I ordered another one so my husband could have his own, too. I could already feel improvement in my neck and shoulder problems after just one night's sleep. My only complaint is that I wish these came in more colors, or that extra covers were available separately."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Board was used it has MANY knife cuts in it. Does not have John Boos logo on it as picture shows. Not even sure its the same product. Not happy.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I love the Blue Air product and these filter covers are awesome!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The quality of this tray table/organizier is great.  I wasn't expecting the table to be so solidly constructed and I do expect the table to last for a very long time.  The spring-loaded legs grip the arm of my couch nicely so the table never slips, and the pockets are very convenient.  All of my remote controls fit in the pockets and slide in and out very easily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"The serving closure on the top will not lock you will have to tape it down if you carry it, and that's  why I brought this item! I learned this the hard way. Brought two of these:-("
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Love it.  It's sturdy and spins well despite a lot of weight on it.  I placed several large glass jars containing dry goods and it makes it a snap to get what I want in my deep kitchen cabinet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,I bought these for my 18 month old and they are ok.  I much prefer the infant ones as they are a little easier for her to hold and the support stick inside the popsicle is a little long on these and she gags on it.  It would probably be good for older kids or adults.  I also don't love the tray.  The popsicles have to sit on the tray in the freezer which is a bit precarious.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"They are affordable and easy to use. The quality is excellent for the price! I've used this product for ~1 year now, and no bag has ever teared on me while decorating sweets.
They fit well with all of the piping tips I have, including couplers. The seam on the side of the bag makes it easy to mark and cut!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Works well even when only partially submerged. Makes frothing easy for beginners like me.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Was really looking forward to this steam mop what a disappointment.  Does not work on high steam.  The steam fresh attachment does not stay attached.  Would like to return but now that it is assembled the handle cannot be unattached.  Don't buy this product keep shopping for one that totally works.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,I was expecting more.  It's quite a workout to use it and the results were subpar at best.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Starting to have problems due to Carpel tunnels--this fixed the problem, good quality easy install, works great!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought these when i received an ice cream maker for Christmas. Love these containers to transport my homemade ice cream to go with any dessert i bring.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Fleece blanket is cozy warm. It was exactly what I wanted.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"If you can lift furniture high enough to get this product under it, you can lift it high enough to put a furniture slider under it.  I guess if you have some furniture that has a lip on it...  I found it worthless for the furniture I was trying to move.  I am a 49 yr of female who was helping my parents (mid to late 70s) move some office furniture in order to paint a room.  Since there was no lip, I just barely lifted the furniture enough for them to slide a furniture sliders underneath each corner.  I returned this for refund- it was useless to me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I really like these. Rounded stick that isn't too heavy and is very easy to handle. Comes in two sleeve punches that are nice to have, too. Cleans easy in the dishwasher. Glad I bought them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I don't love these, but they are hanging in my house. I didn't look closely at the dimensions of this item, so that's my fault for somehow imagining something larger. This was an impulse buy, and the price was right. I also didn't realize that it wasn't 3 boards attached for each plaque - it's a solid board that has lines painted on them. They look nice on the wall though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I gave this as a gift to someone who likes turtles and LOVES cooking. She tells me they are perfect and really cute. So that works for me too! Actually they look even better in person than in the picture.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Very nice but you have to be careful in handling. The edges crack easily.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Beautiful musical snowglobe. Very colorful with all the disney characters and great detail. Makes a nice addition to our Christmas treasures.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The supplier of the filter is pretty understanding, kind, accurate and fair. I was very happy with them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Its nice to have an organizer large enough for the utensils.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This really works nicely.  Now you can add fresh garlic to lots of dishes in just the right size - like granulated only fresh.  Not too hard to clean either.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"This stopper does not work at all. My plumber had to change out my drain to run and he put in a pop up. The previous one I had picked up all of our hair and it worked well so I knew how much hair comes off our heads in just a few days. With this catcher, it might catch 4-5 hair stands in a few days. And while showering I end up standing in 2 inches of water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Soft, soft, soft.  We love them.  We would order again without hesitation."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"A very useful and even attractive help to us fun-sized people (i.e., short).  It folds up by just lifting it at the handle shaped opening on top and opens into a step stool when you put it down.  I use this in my bathroom and laundry room to reach stuff on high shelves and I really like it.  Feels sturdy and well made and does not wobble."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great little bookshelf. All of the holes lined up fine and there was no extra hardware! The rocket and all of the details are actually carved in and painted decently well. There are a few paint blemishes but overall really well done!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"A great little spice rack.  We installed ours behind a cabinet door and it works well.  We don't have matching spice canisters, but the majority of our spices are from Walmart & Aldi...and they fit just fine as they are.  It comes with 2 sets of screws.  One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!  Oh well!  The last screw went in perfectly fine and even with only 3 screws, the rack is solid and doesn't swing or move around when opening/closing the cabinet door.  Good little purchase to help organize the kitchen!  I would recommend this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I really like this thermal. I don't put it in the microwave, though. I heat the water and then pour it in the thermal. I take it with me out in the cold and tea stays hot for hours. It won't spill in my bag at all!

Just love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"This puts out very little oil. It's hard to tell if it's even working. The reason I can tell is that it sounds like it is boiling when it is on. There is definitely a boiling water sound, so I don't know that the ""whisper"" name applies."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"this is very different for us as we are used to the glass.  Our problem is that we've been through three glass ones and when I say the stainless, it seemed to be the answer.  We do miss the waterline though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've made candy with these several times already; caramel, marshmallow, etc. I have never had a problem with the numbers rubbing/melting/slipping off. The actual thermometer doesn't touch the bottom. I don't need a TON of liquid in my pot for it to make contact (I use 2-3 qt pots). It is very easy to clean (hot water and soft soapy sponge) and I'm very happy with my purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Perfect fit.  Great for when you want to store in refrigerator.  Good seal.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Did not come with the rubber grip. Cup way to hot to hold without it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Broke before I could use it! Leg broke during assembly. Cheap materials not fit for intended use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,i have had this clock for a while and it drive me nuts. i have had to fix the time over and over i don't know if its normal but i took the batteries out and not bother using it. i need clock for my kitchen but i can find a different one .
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Just what the bride wanted came out nice with the engraving.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Haven't used the big ones but the small ones work great!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Wonderful product, pan is like it was advertised. I am sure I will enjoy and use for years to come."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"i gave it five stars, you want me to leave a comment too.  have some consideration please!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I had a cute little apple timer like this in college, so I ordered this one as well. When it arrived I stuck it next to my oven. I tried baking a pizza the very next day, setting the timer as usual , but it didn't go off. It made the ticking sound but didn't ring when the time was up. Low and behold, another burnt pizza, because I was waiting for my timer to go off. So disappointing, because it was a really cute timer. I returned it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Hard to drink out of, since the structure ""collapses"" when you grip the ""glass"". The silicone is not firm enough so you have to get used to the glass to not spill the wine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These are so nice, sturdy, like the color choices too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This was a Christmas present for my son and his wife.  So far only greaat comments.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,It feels cool to the touch but is super hard.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This works really well, can change between grams, oz etc and it can be tared too.  The battery life is excellent, I haven't had to change it yet."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Nice and contemporary. Great for the price. Easy to assemble.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,The inside liner already has mold after only a couple of months so the PEV is not as good in preventing mold from damp as it sounds
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"These are nice, but not as good as the York design. These will go in the guest bath.

These are better: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KKXA6C/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details
the handles are easier to grasp."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought this sofa for my class c motorhome.  IT was easy to assemble and it it quite comfortable.  The price was very competetive.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.  You won't go wrong with this purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This product keeps your blades & discs safe and clean when not in use.  I would not have ordered a food processor that did not have this available.  The only con is that the bottom is open - so you have to be careful if you pick up the box.  Just be aware of this and watch young would-be cooks around these kind of appliances.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was very nervous about ordering a rug online because this is a purchase I would normally want to see and feel before buying.  But when I requested that Lowe's bind a 9x12 area rug and they said it would cost $1,000 (even though the rug itself was only $300), I decided I needed to shop around.  This large rug was only $360 and it is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!  The color is perfect; it's soft and deep; it's really perfect!!  I would recommend highly to anyone.  You won't be disappointed!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,my wife's been looking everywhere for this item. Should have known to trust Amazon from the start. She likes them and I liked the price
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is very nice; beats the plastic ones sold in grocery stores by a mile.  Brush appears very sturdy; still don't know where to get replacement brush heads,, but wand is certainly worth keeping.  Product is Very happy with look and is well made."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Pleated patio-door curtains are almost impossible to find in stores anymore, and my 86-year-old mother was not (NOT!) up to changing her travis rod to accommodate anything else.  I ironed the large panel with medium-hot iron to get most of the wrinkles out, and it looks fine.  Size was perfect, and she is happy ... which makes me happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I have not used it much yet, however the well for catching juices is very deep which is what I was looking for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"We LOVE these bowls!!!  We needed something that my husband could eat cereal out of, we could use for soup and even cooking in the microwave.  We might buy another set!  They are tall, which helps keep the soup warm in our drafty house!  (low, flat bowls cool down the soup faster).  These are pretty enough to serve from, in my opinion."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Good product and I think that they are better than the other snagfree types. A much better weaving in your product. THE others i had to cut off the snags.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,It's bigger than I thought it would be. But it arrived quickly and did the job.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Clients love these sheets. They feel ""high end"". Holding up well with frequent washing. No staining. Buy these if you like to spoil your clients!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"These containers are neither leak-proof nor airtight.  However, they are very hand, and I can use them for other purposes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Just received this set.  It is soooo cute!!!  We go camping and this will look really good on our picnic table!!!  It is a nice size.  The mustard and ketchup are smaller than the pair you see sitting on cafe tables...which is nice when you have limited space in the fridge.  The salt and pepper shakers are a larger size.  The colors on the website and on the box are the same colors as the actual products; including the picnic table.  The weight of this set is enough to hold the table cloth down if it is breezy.  Another ""must buy"" for those of us that like this kind of thing!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I really love these curtains!  They really tied everything together in the living space of my new cabin in the woods.  The material is very soft and hangs nicely.  I would definitely buy again!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I love the frame, except I got the wrong size and it was too big and bulky to return for an exchange. Because of that I have been living with the wrong size frame for over a year. Saving up to get the right size frame!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"So far so good, I like the fact that the bottom is waterproof, my old dispenser was ruined because it was not and batteries rusted"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The color is as expected. I was not completely impressed with the lack of plushness. However, it is a nice, light bedspread and I like the fact that it is washable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great light weight little cutting board. Wish they made this one in the bigger size. Goes right in the dishwasher.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,My son and his wife have this at their house and I tried it and loved it and had to have one for myself.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"My sleep number bed has a giant plastic base instead of a box spring, it turns out can't use them!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I like the bed cover, however, it sheds lint like crazy. Ive washed it three times on delicate cycle and dried it on delicate cycle as instructed but it still has a bunch of lint all over the place. Im hoping it will stop soon."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Beautiful product, I just loved it! Definitely very well done carving job on the Tiger eye and I was really impressed by that!!! I want buy more in the future and give them like a gift for my loved ones. Worth every single penny!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"If you have a window AC, this is a must for off-season storage. If you keep your AC in the window year-round, I highly recommend this cover. It will keep dust out of the vents as well as aiding an outside cover in keeping out cold drafts. It's a lot nicer than covering the AC with sheet plastic and towels."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered these for my son's school lunches, and they've worked perfectly for trail mix and small snacks. I have to run between several locations for work, so I also keep one in my bag that is filled with almonds in case I need a snack on the run. It has saved me from vending machine runs several times so far. They are easy to clean, and I haven't had any spills. I love that they are so brightly colored, too. It makes it easy to find in the bottom of my bag."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this vacuum primarily for use on my laminate floors, and it works very well. I'm very pleased with the suction, especially given the price.
The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac.
Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Perfect. Love everything about them. Look great in my kitchen.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,love it... wear it everyday after my shower while drying my hair and applying  makeup.. easy to wash and comes out like new
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered these mini cookie cutters to outline shapes onto my larger cookies that I decorate with royal icing, and these are perfect for that task."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,TOTALLY CUTE! It's the perfect size for my morning coffee and evening tea.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Just the price and size for my wife and myself. I have cooked 7 meals since we bought it and its great.  The Crock comes out and goes right into the dishwasher as well as the cover.  Best Crock Pot we have had so far in many a year.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This rack expands out to twice it's length, and you can fit shoes underneath it - so it ends up holding GOBS of shoes.  Great for a front hallway.  When extended out to it's max, it's easily 4.5-5 feet long.  Easy to put together and a total front hall saver!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bed frame has easy to understand directions and is quick to assemble. Works great and fits twin mattress perfectly. Plenty of room underneath for storage.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I bought a  couple of the duvet covers and they are so nice,  silky  and soft."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Purchased as a Christmas gift.  She will love it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Made well holds all my make brushes, pencils, mascara etc."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I was concerned about how secure this would be holding my pots up but it hasn't had a problem yet. It fits perfectly in the small space I have. I can easily access each pan or pot I need without too much of a problem. The couple of hook on the back are a little difficult to get to but I put items there that I hardly use anyway.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Have had the Bella 13964 for just over a month and have used it 3 times. Very happy with the results. Love the purple color!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"These shelf liners are handy - sized and formed to fit the shelf perfectly!  The reason for four stars and not five is they're a bit thin; that makes them easy for the vendor to pack and send but does raise the question of how durable they'll be.  Other than that concern about durability, just right!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These Small Tortilla Bowls Makers are a Great Alternative to frying Tortillas by Baking them in the Oven. I use regular size corn tortillas and they look Terrific. I found many other uses from all kinds of small Tostadas, and many other Mexican Food Variations to Salads and even Desserts. My Favorite is making Individual Apple Pies with Pastry Dough, you don't even have to oil or spray the Tortilla Bowls, the butter in the Pie Dough takes care of that, I Bake Eight at a time, the two sets I ordered it, a little bit of work but is worth it!

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top. I keep finding more uses for The Tortilla Bowl Makers. Everyone loves getting their own Individual Little Pie! ...Thank You D.D."

I totally would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys a strong full bodied black tea - delicious."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,...i love OXO good grip products.....i swear...if i didn't have this and my scissors i would starve to death as i can't get things opened without them......this works on all sizes of tops....and really gives you the fulcrum needed to leverage things open even if you are a weakling like me.......bought one for my best friend who has terrible arthritis and it is a great help for he.....
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This knife sharpener works really well I also sharpen my sewing scissors with it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,the beater blade works great... we use this all the time over the stock beater
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"As the title states, it does its job decently (It could be better) but it is really flimsy. After applying pressure to it you have to trace it back with something otherwise you won't be able to notice the shape. I used it for a couple of times VERY carefully and it broke anyways, so caveat emptor.

Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I own a few other komachi knives and this one is no different! They all are sharp and slice very cleanly. I use this one as it suggests for fruits and some vegetables. It's excellent on fruits with a natural wax or tough rind like orange because of the ridging helps keep the item you're slicing on the knife. I've had an orange slip while I was trying to cut it with a smooth blade, not fun. My only qualm is that for some reason this knife's sheath is not like the rest the sheath has a little part that allows it to stand which keeps it from fitting into the drawers with the other knives because it is a bit bulky. But otherwise its a good buy!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"Other than that, what's there to complain about?
The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white? It is unbelievably noisy when operating and couldn't possibly be used any place you want to have a conversation. If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it. BTW, there's now a 2-bottle version. It doesn't work any better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,This is a good thermometer.  I wish it were faster but I honestly haven't found one that was fast.  The probe it came with frayed after about a year.  The replacement probe is thinner and coated so it makes smaller holes and is fray-resistant.  As with any thermometer calibrating is a must.  Mine was off 3 degrees on the high side.  Ice water should be 32F and boiling water 212F.  Hold the CAL button for 5 seconds then use the arrow buttons to say how many degrees you want to adjust it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Great cheap pots. Dishwasher safe (no nasty exterior coating like other pots) Good nonstick interior all the way to the rim. Doesn't chip easily. I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

(it is quite thin, though, maybe too thin for a gas burner, but works great on electric)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Really to strong, was expecting the pleasant aroma of Jasmine, instead got a heavy sweet smell unlike Jasmine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Nice material, but isn't all that practical to me. I reverted back to squashing garlic with my knife to peel and manually chopping it. Other times I just use my food processor for bulk garlic and mason jar storage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Very cute.  I made two out of this towel...same design on both sides...crocheted a top with button to hang from oven or refrigerator door handle.  Makes two nice gifts.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Too much trouble putting up this film.  Followed Instructions but still could not take out the bubbles and wrinkles.  Worked on it over and over and still not so great.  The film would block the heat and sun okay but the trouble of putting it up and trying to make it look half way decent was not worth the trouble.  I need to find something else for my storm door and windows because of the frustration of putting up the film.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

Is still a great stool, just not safe non slip.... it is super sturdy and easy to use, just stay dry"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I purchased this tablecloth to use on Easter.  I removed it from the packaging and washed it in cold water on the ""hand wash"" cycle and dryed it on low.  It came out completely unusable.  It was full of snags, runs and wrinkles."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"So far (less than a month) it is working fine.  It pretty well matches a new NiCad.  It lasts for one and a half tanks of water.  I am a little disappointed because I was expecting at least enough capacity for two runs before recharging it.  Anyway, it will still be worth it if it lasts at least two or three years.  I'll update then."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great quality! Love the colors. So glad I ordered this. Happy in Gilbert Az :)
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,i did half of my polo shirt and almost used half of the tank. It works though so i am good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Having had an allergy test done, I was found to have pretty strong allergies to Dust Mites. After having my physician suggest getting a bed encasement i chose to go with this offering. One thing i read was that other customers complained of the ""heat"" they experienced. This encasement has 2 sides... one more terrycloth like and one smooth and almost silky. I chose to put the terrycloth side down and have the smoother side near my sheet set. I've not had any issues with heat (matter of fact I was quite cold last night) and my stuffiness in the morning is SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. Due specifically to the improved dust mite situation, i'm sleeping SOOOOOO much better!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Perfect size for a small counter top. Love the warm white and the clean retro style is very now. Thanks Daewoo.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This handy gadget works really well for filling plastic storage bags, even with soup.  They also worked great for drying my rubber gloves.  The folding feature is really nice for storage of the tool."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Talk about a game changer... this product has been outstanding!  Its the best adult version of an Easy Bake Oven!  We love Tater Tots! Cheerz!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Used the item once. The lid was unbelievably tight, it wouldn't budge. Finally, I pried it off and gave it a go. Completely underwhelming. I used mini ice cubes and the motor was still strained to the point of smoking. Also, there is no way this should be marketed as a travel cup, the blender attachment is in the bottom of the cup and the cup itself is massive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Hi all,

This is a good item. It does what it is supposed to do. I use it for working out sessions and it has multiple options for beeping and vibrating. It works quite well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using a hand grinder for years, but it had a difficult time cutting through venison sinew.  Then I bought this ... cuts through all the cuts of meat with ease.  Wish I had bought one years ago."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love the clear sides to view contents, and I love the way the dividers give flexibility in what size divisions are chosen.  The product walks the line between organizing content and losing storage space very nicely and feels durable enough to withstand being stored in a dusty basement.  I plan to purchase another one of these next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I was about to purchase this item until I noticed that ALL BUT 2 of their feedback ratings are all listed within a day or two of each other.  If you click on each reviewer, you will see they have only reviewed this one item in their entire history.  6 of 8 of the reviews here clearly seem to be illegitimate."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is a beautiful table runner and looks great on my antique table.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,I bought 10 of them and one of the corners was broken.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Nice shoulders, but the pants bars do not have any grippy coating as advertised.  The pants fall off pretty easily.  I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.  I bought these for the suit coats, and they preserve the shape on those supremely well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Does slice thinly for coleslaw.  My husband loves using it for slicing.  Makes life much easier.  Easy to clean, then ready to use again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Love them, just thought they would be a bit bigger!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This Cookware Set Has Performed Great so Far I've Only Had It for about 2 Weeks But Whatever I Have Cooked Has Slid Right out Of on Cleaning The Only Bad Part Is That These Are Not Dishwasher Safe.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Worked great!! A little hard to fold into the box !! But they looked great and stayed put once it was accomplished!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"Seemed to be just fine and then suddenly just quit working after about 6 months. Cleaned the terminals on battery, etc. Nope - it's a goner. Not my unit as I had the old Dyson battery. Charged it up and it runs my unit. Try another brand I guess."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"The bed frame glide replaced the wheels attached to my bed. It was a simple process to do, pulled the wheels off and attach the bed glides."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I like using it, light and sturdy, cutting cheese and truffles well, good find adjustments, nice solid metal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"At first glance I thought this will never last.  However, it's holding up well and the price was great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Perfect for the ""library!""  But started to rust where it hangs from the toilet tank."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great price. Works well at filtering the sediments in my water. I will buy again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Easy to cut, let the right amount of light in and keeps peepers out."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This product is way less expensive and does the same job as the original filter, only it is reusable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Very sturdy little chair and when they say it holds 300 pounds, they mean it.  The only thing I miss is the back doesn't recline, but I use it as a work chair, not a relaxing chair."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Wonderful product.  Shipped promptly.  Ordered about ten sets a gifts.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Very cute and pretty realistic. I've made a few arrangements with these since I can never keep actual live plants alive.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Great for carpet stairs, though not as great for wood stairs. Tends to scratch them a bit with the plastic casing for the brush. Extremely happy though how it picks up dog hair so easily :)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I ordered this to display our wedding pics & I love it! Extremely well made & detailed. The advertisement photo doesn't do it justice!!!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Yup, they work and they came on time. What else does one say about vacuum cleaner bags. Oh, the paper/mesh is an improvement over old bags of sizes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The sock, underwear and other drawer are great. The bra holder is good but not for larger cup sizes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I love it.  Looks great and very easy to install. I installed it myself ;)
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I bought 2 sets of these ramekins.  I haven't used them yet.  They are really nice.  I just wish they were 6 ounces, it seems they are a little small.  I think these should come in a set of 4 so they are not quite as expensive as buying them 2 at a time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Very nice, elegant glass and does improve the taste of wine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Love the product, works great - not so happy with not getting my 2 free blades like it advertises."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,We looked everywhere in stores for a product like this with no luck.  Thankfully we found it online. It is precisely what we needed to give some more hanging space in the closet. The product is durable and priced reasonably.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased this in an attempt to help my wife (who has chronic neck pain) have more support in the car.  She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she forgot it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,big improvement over my  kids old lunchbox. I use all sorts of different containers for his lunch and they all fit with room to spare..
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Flimsy, JUNK, hardly a  Panacea, Not nearly worth the money.
Has the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen,  omitting information as how to sequence the pieces

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,What a gorgeous cup in such a gorgeous box. I'm beginning to collect mismatched teacups and this is my newest and favorite. What amazing quality and so pretty. Arrived perfectly safe in Amazon shipping. Very happy with my choice.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent packaging, Fast shipping , super quality for the right price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love it! It looks great in our entryway and despite the abuse from my boys, it's fine!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"We've had this two years now.  We use it sporadically, so perhaps 80-100 oranges in those two years.  It is plastic and it was $20, but somehow it does not seem cheap (pieces fit well, plastic is strong).  But no issues or no complaints so far.  Nothing has broken, and it just works.  Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.  One reviewer complained about batteries....unit plugs in, no batteries, so at least 1 false negative review.

03/2018: still going."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Since I got a dog with a double coat, this has been a lifesaver whenever I see some hair stuck in corners. I hate using our large vacuum more than once a week, so between the roomba and this small handy tool our floor is kept really clean, even during shedding season. I also used it to vacuum my car and got through the backseats and the passenger seat before it ran out of battery, and my car was NOT clean at all when I started, so I think the battery lasts a good 15-20 minutes on a full charge. This has got to be one of my best purchases this year!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Got these for one of the bedrooms, but these are so lovely they can be used anywhere.  Fantastic quality and colors are vivid.  Highly recommended."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Molded within a couple months, but I'm in Texas. Good thing it was really easy to clean and felt heavier than most of the cheap shower liners. Really worth the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I bought one of these because I was afraid the 18' kit would be just a bit short.  I was right.  With this plus the 18' kit, it's perfect.
As a side note, in case you're wondering, it screws onto the Rutland brush rods perfectly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,This is a reorder. Rated before whwn originally purchase.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I feel like an idiot for living this long without a waffle maker. Oil that baby up before the first use then you are good to go for delicious breakfast. Next up to try is a mac and cheese waffle. Obviously this product is partially at fault for my newest weight gain.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is a lightweight pot that heats up and cools down very quickly.  It is scrape proof and minimally non-stick.  For the price, it is a good pot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love it.  This one has an extra step, three instead of two with my other one.  All parts fit securely, so it's not easy to figure out if you don't know the procedure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Le Creuset - what can I say - You get what you pay for!  I love all of my pieces and understand the price.  Buy one piece and you will want more.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,perfect design. I redid my bathroom and have these on a shelf. I have 12 of them. Would be perfect for the pantry as well. Highly recommend if you are looking to get organized
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"If you pay attention to the type and cut of the blade. If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade. Also, given that garden tools have heavier tougher blades, this tool does sometimes loosen up during rigorous sharpening. I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit before using this sharpener. But, for the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"We use on the door that goes to the garage to keep hats and mittens in and on the door of our baby girls' room to keep her little matching outfits in.  I like that the pockets are mesh in case items that are damp are place in there so that they can dry.  I don't see much of a point to the double pocket.  The hangers that came with it are useless as they do not fit over ANY door that is in our house.  I ended up spending about as much money on 3M command hooks to hang it as I did on the organizer itself, but it works."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,It's still in the box because I am saving it for a special time to give to my husband. He loves smiley faces so will probably give it to him for Valentines. I really like it so I know he will!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Not impossible to put together by yourself. Only scratched one place in a not very noticeable place. Get many compliments on it and has lots of storage.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love this thing! What an amazingly simple concept. It is really nothing more than a big mason jar with a stainless steel infuser, but it works perfectly and makes it possible to enjoy totally individualized iced tea or coffee. The stainless steel filter is made of super fine mesh. It is smooth and relatively easy to clean. Coffee does get between the double screen and you cannot get it out, but, to me, that's no big deal. I am going to buy one for friends and family who love iced coffee as much as I do. My only suggestion: create cute lids. Colors, wood covers or designs would only enhance this already great product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this rug pad to replace a open waffle-type rug pad that I had used for many years. My, how crappy the waffle-style pad is in comparison! This is easy to trim down to size with decent scissors, and it feels great underfoot. Also, there is absolutely zero slippage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,I love this roaster. I use it for everything from roasts to slow cooker. I would have given it 5 stars except after a year the enamel insert got a chip and so far I cannot find a replacement.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great bottle for 4 1/2 year old to take to school. Durable and great color. Only good for cold water though per instruction manual
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Super cute & great price! Have it in the blue and white too!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Order this along with my cotton candy machine and it taste great. Creates nice soft cotton candy in seconds using the Great northern cotton candy machine. Just doesnt seem to have as much of a strong flavor as the other type of flossugars do.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Darn the light over powers the great look of the parrots, look better when off."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Edit: Next day, friends over for barbeque. Knives were the center of attention. These colorful tools made fast work of steaks, by cut right through whole filet, and prepared assorted melons in record time. Ordered second set over dinner!

After using my pocket knife to cut a canteloupe, I decided it was time to replace a couple of ancient Henkels knives. I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off. To my relief, the cutting edge is exposed stainless steel that will sharpen nicely. Promptly tried the unusually serrated utility knife to cut a melon; I had never seen a blade quite like the wavey edge on the utility and bread knives - fantastic! Ordering extras to take as hostess gifts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"When it comes to wine I tend to over indulge and before I know it, I blow my diet.  What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.  This comes in a package of 2 wine glasses and they are dishwasher safe.  I really like this product and would recommend this to all my friends and family who are tracking their alcohol intake."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Getting ready to move.  Perfect assortment of bags for clothes, winter stuff, blankets, pillows, etc."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought for my mom and she loves them. True to the color. I'm going to order the orange for my living room.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Meh. Rug does not resemble photos, colors are much deeper and stand out more. Quality seems to be OK, but certainly not so great for the price point. If you need an area rug, it will do....but its much more difficult to incorporate ANYTHING other than neutral colors. Would not recommend for the price, and if i could return? I would."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought as a gift for a cousin.  Very nice.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Works perfectly. I just rec'd and used this for the first time. I actually bought two of them, one for me and one for my daughter overseas. I don't own a big machine, but I wanted to try this. I didn't have an issue with the little slit in the valve."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I needed a larger tea kettle and liked the looks of this one. I was changing for another reason also, that the handle became very hot when it was used so I was hoping for a handle that remained cooler. However, this is not the case, but I still like its looks and just use a potholder when boiling water for tea."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Overall the pan is a great value.  I use it mostly for frying foods.  The only drawback is that the finish on the frying surface grew dull after the first use and no matter what I do it stays dull and marbled looking.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Love these sheets!  This makes my 2nd purchase.  Soft, wrinkle free, and keeps me cooler at night!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love this pillow. I can make it as ""plump"" as I please. It's very cuddly too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Easy to review. The kid DDS love them!  Thanks
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Absolutely love this kitchen towel.  I redecorated my kitchen in owl theme and this looks perfect in there.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

Update 12/14/2010.  This was my first experience returning a purchase to Amazon.  The process was painless, and the refund was quick."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"It's beautiful! Well constructed . The picture doesn't do it justice. If you work at it, you could fit a queen size pillow in it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Loved this party decoration.  Large, beautiful colors and durable material.  Great all the way around. Fun party decoration which will catch attention."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Use it in my Duvet cover. Fluffy and perfect fit!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"We got these dishes for our motorhome. Not only were they priced right and durable, what they were made of and where they were made were also huge factors in our purchase. We used these dishes every day  for a 2 1/2 month travel trip. They held up great. I am looking forward to using them next summer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These are actually great to make small desserts in! not just for candles! Can do personal pies, personal cookies, personal dips in."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is a great combo. Can't say enough about how well this works. Can cook 2 different items at once. Make chili and cornbread at the same time.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Been using this over a year now, and have not had any problems.

We use with bagels, toast, open faced sandwiches, reheating dishes, reheating bread sticks, pizza, etc.

This things works great :)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I liked that I found 3 different sizes of scoops. I use them for a lot of things. Good price, good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,And this was cheap. No reason to spend more money and waste of materials to throw away a blender base that still works.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Super cute and appears to be great quality! Highly recommend!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I chose this set for the double heart disk, and it worked well.  I'm looking forward to trying out the flowers disks for Easter & Mothers Day.  A friend suggested using the five-petal flower disk with peanut butter cookie dough, and placing a chocolate chip in the center."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.

bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.

as they say in the brew community, ""Cheers!"""
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"You could make one of these probably for about the same price or much cheaper but really, the magnet makes all the difference. Having this thing on my fridge at all times makes going from stove, to raw ingredients, to the next phase all very easy and with no mucking around with towel drawers or dirtying up handles and everything in my kitchen.
Just one step closer to having things organized"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I bought these for my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" color; it was not flattering at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This looks so good and really changes the look of the bathroom. We were going for a Game of Thrones theme and it works perfectly for our purpose.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,These were just as described. This is my second set of these. Love using glass as storage as I am working to remove plastic from touching our food. They work well in dishwasher. Great product! Love the sizes too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Love, love, love, my bentgo lunch boxes.  I bought several to give as gifts to my grandchildren, they all use them all the time. Awesome buy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This product is the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. We have to empty it and do laundry about once a week between the two of us. It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge. I used a couple of command hooks to hold my bag up, but it's not an ideal solution."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Nice and fluffy towel but not as absorbent as I think they should be, the however was nicely and return the fluffiness."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is cute, the sugar packets are much thinner than this is so I just loaded it up with tea bags and set it next to my kureg. The color is solid black and it has a good weight to it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,The shells are beautiful and just what I'm looking for.  Thanks.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,This seems to work pretty well - though it could be a bit bigger.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be ordering more!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I actually bought this to use with small jar candles rather than tarts. It works perfectly for me and I love the pretty green color. I cannot have an open flame in my office, so this is an excellent substitute. It heats the small candle thoroughly, does not take up lot of room, and is easy to use. The cord could be longer, but this is not a deal breaker. I love the product itself and am very happy I decided to get it. My office smells wonderful all the time now!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These are just perfect, exactly what I was looking for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"It isn't bad, good for the price.  However, it is shipped folded in half, and rolled up, so it takes a while to flatten.  It is very light, so movement (even walking) on it, pulls it out from under the furniture and it bunches up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this to brine pork loin for making Canadian bacon. A 2 - 3 pound roast fits nicely, plenty of room to insure the meat is submerged completely, the top fits tight enough that I can turn it upside down without it leaking (not recommended)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

After all, I am happy with the pot for the price and the build quality. Not sure if I would pay extra $30+ for the fancy features Zojirushi brand offers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Ordered this black faux leather chair for my desk-top computer.  It is wonderful to sit in--comfortable, can adjust to my 5'9"" frame.  I sit for hours sometimes & I don't get back pain or other aches.  Easy to adjust, no popping as someone else mentioned.  My husband put it together in a few minutes without difficulty.  Very happy with this chair."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"really good juicer. We have had to for over a month now and have no problems at all. It does extract a lot of the pulp, so if you don't like that, you might want a different option, but other than that, no complaint!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is a neck support system that at first feels a little stiff. But that is temporary condition as it responds to your body heat to relax to a form fitting neck support. My wife loves it now where as originally she was not impressed now she loves it. I am buying another for my self. I tried it also and found surprisingly good. You must give this a little time to shape to your neck with out becoming so soft as to give little to no support.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"LOOOOOOVE THESE BLINDS!  We furnished our entire house with them and they're SO CLEAN looking, easy to install, and inexpensive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I really like these candles. They look real, they have a nice vanilla scent. You can't use these to scent your space as they are very mild, but they are very pretty. I used them with pine branches at my Christmas party and people thought the flames were too close to the branches and would catch fire!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This glass product is clear glass.  You can see inside so you know what you left inside the last time you used it.  It works good, the lid keeps the flies out."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Seems like such a small little bathroom gadget couldn't bring so much joy but you would be wrong. Nothing worse than a bar of soap all gunky in the shower. I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it! The only thing I worry about is possibly bumping into it and breaking it, maybe in the future design they should consider a little suction cup on the base."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I would give this zero stars if I could.  It opened THREE normal sized cans - very, very, very slowly.  Then it stopped working and just made clicking sounds.  Absolutely worthless piece of junk.  The concept is good, and I think others make better ones.  But this one was a total waste of $20."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Doesn't get warm even after sitting on it for hours.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Got this for the guest room in my son's house, since I am the guest usually.  Perfect for me.  Inexpensive and can see the time any time I wake up without my glasses."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I adore this pan so much so I have 2 but the colr upon the first hand washing I might add tends to be on the orangey side of the red family and not a bright Pop red... The quality is superior and the name says it all and the price was outstanding 5*****s
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am in love with this!  I am huge into comfort travel, and this product is perfect for that.  It is large enough for me, so soft, and I love the front zipper pouch to protect valuables while you snooze...or in my case snacks.  It folds back into itself and I personally think it is a good size when properly put away.  I am using it right now on the couch while I type this...I have a feeling it is going to be used a lot more than on the plane!  Got this discounted to try it out, so glad I did, it is my new best friend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,This little guy works pretty well!  I've had it for around two years now and it has held up to daily use in my house.  I'd definitely recommend it.  This can opener has held up better than any of the models I've owned in the past.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"great clock. I have used it now for over 5 years without issue.  I use too have to get up every other day at different times, the reason I bought it.  great clock no issues for over 5 years now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I had high hopes for this set. I was looking for something a little less scary than stainless, and have heard some good things. After one use on the stovetop the bottom of the pan on the outside began to wear off and became sticky. I sent back ASAP. Not sure if I got a faulty pan but I didn't want to take any chances. Received a full refund and purchased a SS set and will never go back. Good luck."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,It has been a fine slow cooker so far and looks very nice. I suspect after a couple years it will start breaking down since so much of it is plastic. We have gone through so many that are built like this but the more expensive ones don't seem to be any better in this regard nor do they cook any better based on my experience.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Okay... let me start by saying that I have never used this apple corer on apples. I used it on potatoes to make a recipe called potatoe bombs (stuffed baked potatoes). This little device worked great in coring the potatoes and I imagine it would do a great job on coring an apple too. My recipe turned out great and this corer worked very well, helping cut down on prep time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This chair side table is just perfect for me. There are shelves for my remotes, magazines, eyeglasses and whatever else. Leaves the top shelf free for drinks and snacks. It was easy to assemble. The directions sheet was informative and listed all of the hardware so you know everything is there. I'm glad I made this purchase. Works just fine for me. Thank you."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"While not perfect - this one is much better than the others we tried.  It is larger than the other ones tried and holds more soap = less filling.  It has an off switch which is wonderful when moving it or filling it.  There is a wheel on the side where you can adjust the amount of soap that comes out easily.  The only issue I have had is sometimes it takes 2 times of putting a hand under it in order to get the soap to come out.  I bought one for myself and my son and both are still working after 3 months.  That might not sound like much, but the others we tried quit after less time - some not at all.  Will update if anything serious develops"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,My tongs went to a church barbecue and ended up in the utensil drawer so I bought these to replace them.  These are much better than the ones in the church drawer!  I really like them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is a very low napped rug. I thought it was gray and white but it looks more like gray and cream. I have it in a high traffic area and its easy to keep clean. Im very happy with this.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Very pretty and arrived in excellent shape. They do not provide privacy as you can see through them but they soften the light.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Why pay the electric company to scramble a few eggs or blend up a protein shake? Pocket the difference and you'll live better in the long run.  Please take in to account that the average mixer has a short lifespan and is a recycling nightmare, also.  Lose a beater for your electric mixer?  It's going to cost nearly as much as a new hand mixer to replace.  Lose a flip from your quick shake, NO PROBLEM, contact your friendly neighborhood Tupper Consultant and they'll get you a new one for a great price-problem solved in a flash! I make up everything from gravies and sauce mixes to shakes and scrambles in less time than it takes to drag out the electric mixer and set it up.  Extra bonus keep the little ones busy and happy.  Load the ice cold milk and instant pudding mix in your Quick Shake, seal it up and let them jump, bounce and shake their way to a cool, tasty protein-packed treat!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I use this every day to keep my lunches chilled. It is large enough to hold a couple blue ice blocks along with a sealed bowl of my meal. It seems to be well made. It is much better than the plastic bags I had been using to carry my food to the office.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The clock arrived quickly but i hate packaging so much. It wrap and wrapped with packing tape... it stick like crazy. I used knife to open it but damn! its too many packing tape.

Overall This is a good product. I got the orange one for my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture for the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Want to reach the last little bit that's waaaay down at the bottom of that jar?  This Norpro Silicone Jar/Icing Spatula does just that; cleanly scrapes up remaining morsels even in narrow jars because of its slim size. As far as icing is concerned; haven't had an easier time of frosting cakes or cupcakes since purchasing this product; smooth application, manoeuverable, fits right down into the hole of angel food cakes!  Great for smoothing the frosting, creating peaks and swirls."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This drying rack is a work of art.  Beautifully made of hard rock maple and finished to perfection.  All edges are rounded and smooth; no splinters. The dowels are thick and sturdy so no sagging.  Heirloom quality; would be great for displaying quilts.  And, it is made in the USA.  Thank you for making such a beautiful and useful product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having.
These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Arrived in perfect condition. This pan is great..  a nice weight, not at all flimsy like some of the pans I've had in the past.  Can't wait to start using it!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Can't beat this time tested design.  Easy installation... highly functional ...priced right.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Was so disappointed this is so small not worth the money then there was a metal rod in the box I guess to add weight. I will not buy from this seller again it was an embarrassing gift for my daughter
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Ordered this when the faucet on my Brita Ultra broke. The color doesn't match (wish this came in white as well) but it works very well. There was no smell on this. I still washed it thoroughly before using. It fits Brita Ultra perfectly and actually allows a much more consistent and stronger water flow than the original faucet. Go for this if you need a replacement for your water faucet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,Stopped working after one use still waiting on my refund
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"It was a snap to install and these fit well in our kids closets, my wife uses these to organize clothes and other stuff.  If the closet is not a walk in and you need more space, these are great items."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Didn't really help make a difference.  Must be time for a new robot
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,These lights add a nice warm accent to my bedroom.  I wrapped them around the canopy posts of my bed and it looks very inviting and calming.  They are bright enough but not so bright that it is hard to look at.  They don't seem to heat up too hot although I don't check that very often since they are up so high.  They just add a lovely feature to my room that lights it with a warm tone that seems to make everything else in my room look nicer than it really is so I always have them on if guests come over!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Arrived with several minor scratches on it. Not bad for the price but the scuffs and scratches bother me.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I don't now about the rest of you, but it certainly seems like a drawer full of clothes, kitchen towels, socks, underwear, etc. takes on its own odor after a time. This little bags take that smell out within about a week! Amazing and successful. I prefer using natural unscented products for cleaning, bathing, laundry, etc., and these little gems definitely fill the bill for destroying annoying odors. Another plus with these are they can be ""recharged"" just by placing them in the sun for the prescribed time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Love love love the way I can precisely measure what I need while simultaneously being able to sift flour for a recipe.  I would never be without this little Sifter.  Cleans up like a dream and the sifting mechanism is precision.  One of the best kitchen gadget purchases I've ever made!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"While the boxes are nice, the clasps that hook onto the cover or another container are flimsy and break easily.  I WASN'T a happy camper when carrying the whole contraption down to the basement and the cover popped off because of a broken clasp.  Fortunately, only 4 ornaments broke.  I will be buying a different storage container next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Works great, grinds pepper like there's no tomorrow, lol, seriously this is a good peppermill for the money spent...not too big and not too small, just the right size for a table setting."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"For a memory foam/cooling gel pillow less than $100, this one is a quality product. Product is exactly as described, very soft, and keeps very cool. I wish it was not quite so soft, and was a bit firmer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I already have a full blown carpet steamer (Hoover brand) that works and that for the most part suits my needs for large carpet areas, but I wanted something less cumbersome for small events/spills/dog puke and such, and for stairs and tighter spaces that the larger cleaner can't easily get to. This fits the bill. It's easy to haul, store, use and clean (and sadly I have had opportunity to use it regularly!)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Great product! I use it to store my homemade coconut milk. Glass storage is the best.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"after checking all over for the perfect toaster, we found this one. It toasts to each family members likes. Easy to use, toasts large pieces bread.  Plug is in frount , little inconvienent, but can live with it. Amazon had the best price. would recomend this toaster"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,I ordered these bags and was sent some cheap Version and knock off. I am terribly disappointed in what they sent me. But of course at this price point it's not worth my time to it send back.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Good quality and print is nice.  On the thin side as far as throws go, but it's just what we wanted...a thinner layer for summer.  Plus, perfect for Star Wars fans!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I love the material. Its so soft and the color is just as the picture . of coarse my husband didn't like it but its really cool and it works great with out room decor!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Well, I gathered all my moth traps up at the end of the summer and looked in them to find the Safer (darn-it more expensive) traps had captured way more moths than the other brands.  Can't argue there.  I do wonder though, why the pheromone thing has been made even smaller?? Still, I want to pay less!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"arrived on time, great product, looks nice and clean on the counter and works well, feels sturdy"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I had one of these exact covers a few years back in a plum color and I absolutely loved it so when I updated my bedding I new I had to have another one of these!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Had a mismatched header vs bed frame.  This worked great! Have recommended since!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Good mix - my favorite is still the Goloka Nag Champa
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"These bags seemed small at first but once I put items in them, I found that they spread out a bit and I was pleasantly surprised at their actual capacity. I'm looking forward to using them this summer when I pickup my CSA share, as the produce is quite fresh and therefore still has dirt on it. This will allow for me to shake off the dirty and not get the insides of my normal grocery bags all dirty. They are nice and small so that I can easily always have one on hand too. I like that they are all natural cotton and free trade."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I purchased this for my new loveseat. Its add says ""fits most loveseats"" . I would argue that. The cover is quite small and barely covers 3/4 of the seating area. It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.  I probably would have returned it but it was worth my time and the price of the product. I would not recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Works perfectly.  No danger of me cutting my hand with a knige trying to get out the inner seeded core.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Pretty but not functional. Fabric is too light and it doesn't stay in place whatsoever no matter how often you adjust it. Give it 3-stars due to the description being accurate and loving the color
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Super cute, but realistically I'm not sure how anyone makes these work as advertised.  I haven't tried them myself.  My 15 yr old daughter wanted these and after trying once and it being kind of a pain they are now just taking up space in my cupboard."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I've been using these cookie sheets for years. My originals are in great shape but I ordered a couple more for our vacation home. They arrived with a few dents but I don't think this will affect the function of the pans.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,We used it for a party.  After the party we put the sever in the refrigerator and used it a few days later for another party. I washed the unit by hand and washed the storage cups in the refrigerator. At first we kept the condiments cool with ice cubes and then used small ice packs.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I needed white balloons specifically for a birthday party craft.  When these arrived, I was a little concerned because they looked very yellow.  I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,These are great toilet brush holders. Sleek design and appear well made
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.  I'm disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Nice pans, good deal, didn't realize the bottom were not smooth.  Gave to a friend with a gas stove."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,It makes using those deep shelves in my linen closet so more accessible and organized. It is made well and doesn't wobble.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.  That would be the big drawback to the mop."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I know this is intended for shoes, but I needed something to hold my assortment of paper punches. I make handcrafted greeting cards, and use a lot of different punches in my creations: border punches, corner punches, flower/leaf/branch punches, snowflakes, tags, circles, etc. etc.

This organizer works perfectly!  The clear pockets allow me to see the punches, and I have easy access to them.  Some of my punches are ""mega"" size, and they fit perfectly into the pockets.  For smaller punches, I can store several related punches in a single pocket.

Very happy with the purchase so far -- it seems to be holding up well (after about 6 weeks of use)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The color is not bright gold, it's more of a rose gold.  But that works out nicely for me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"In terms of overall durability, they're great, but they do scratch very easily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Helps cool my memory mattress a little but not a lot.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,What a great vacuum. I read the review first and you all were right. I thought my old vacuum was great but I did a pass with that then I did a pass with the Hoover and was grossed out!!! I could not believe all the additional cat/dog hair that it pulled out of the carpet. My back is not so great but this is easy to handle. This is my first bagless system and I really thought I would hate it but it empties out very easy & goes right back on the system with no problem. I only wish the hose was a bit more flexible but I believe over time it will become more stretchable.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,My wife is studying South American Shamanism and she is very happy with this item.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"What can I say....it holds ice.  These are handy to have but hard to find, so I was glad to see these listed at Amazon.

We freeze our leftover coffee into cubes for iced coffee or to run thru the blender with a little sugar, chocolate and milk or cream for a nice cold summer treat."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"AWESOME, awesome, awesome! We use it in our entry way to hang keys and it's sturdy and has tons of character. Always puts a smile on people's faces when they see it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and works perfectly plus you get the plastic lids.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great product! It is the perfect size for me to put in some carrots and some ranch dressing for a late afternoon snack. The included ice pack is a little difficult to remove the first few times, but it's only a minor inconvenience. All in all, I love this little container. Some mornings I will even take oatmeal in it instead for breakfast when I get to work - it's the perfect size! I would definitely recommend to all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased these curtains to go up in my living room to help block some of the light the comes in through our large window. The curtains are of great quality material, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how nice they were. They're also made of a nice heavy fabric that does a great job of blocking out light."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am a hot sleeper! My husband tells me that my body gives off so much heat that I'm like a furnace. That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow. I would not sleep on it alone though, I put it on top of my other pillow and it's perfect. I hope this helps you make a purchase!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Not the clear quality I was expecting, probably won't be using it where I thought I would. It's ok, just not great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,This thermostat worked great at first but soon crapped out. This is the second digital thermometer that I have tried this grilling season with both failing. I have since ordered the old school analog thermometer. I have had these last for years. Live and learn.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"We got two of these for our sons (who were both graduating). It was fun to personalize them, and we have them as keepsakes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Beautiful set. Sadly, one of the bowls was broken on arrival. It would be a good thing if the inside of the box had a layer of small bubble wrap or something. Other than that I am so happy with this purchase!  Holding perfect portion sizes and is really nicely constructed too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I read other reviews but bought this anyway. And I am not sorry. I have a smaller tub/shower so the words can be a little hard to read, But everyone I showed it to had no problem reading it and knowing what it was."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"The quality was so bad it was laughable. The plastic is so flimsy that it won't latch shut without a  gap. Not exactly going to seal in the freshness. Also, the plastic ""hinges"" look really fragile. I'm returning it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This box spring is sturdy and sits high, which I love as I am able to now use under bed storage. Takes a matter of minutes to set up with use of a screwdriver to tighten bolts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The button wells are a bit shallow, but they still came out cute.  I used candy melts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent grinder for me.  I like good coffee, but I am not an expert on coffee."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Works wonderfully to date after a few months. This thing cooks an epic amount of rice. I haven't even been able to use all the crazy features on it yet. But all around solid product and it was at a great price point compared to other similar rice cookers when I bought it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"It has a horrible strong chemical and plastic smell that doesn't go away even after being washed with soap several times. I also tried leaving soaking in water with dishwashing soap for four days and the strong chemucsl and plastic smell remains. The bad thing is that the odor gets into the Q-Tips.

Beautiful design but not good product materials."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Was a gift, so don't know how it is. It is beautiful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Love this! Well made! Got it for storage in the bathroom. Fits double rolls of toilet paper well.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"very slow toasting, my rye bread becomes rock hard before it's toasted."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is a fantastic, easy to apply product that will put the shine back on hardwood and tile floors!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Well it is a can opener and it opens cans.  What more can you ask of a CAN OPENER.  It is very attractive.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available for this size, I got what I paid for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Seems to be ok on my butcher block .Not sure if it works any better than mineral oil.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Love it! Love the size, have it over tv with a dark blue night-light bulb inside (looks aqua when reflected through the white star). Will eventually put in a changing light. Placed cord side on bottom and hung with few laps of clear jewelry thread around star and tied at top for a loop."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"An excellent product, solid and well-made. These relatively rare black-colored ones were about four times more expensive than the usual red-colored ones, although both are made of the same molded ABS plastic."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Blueair recommends changing the filters for their air purifiers every six months.

The entire system is not inexpensive because the purifier is expensive and the replacement filters seem relatively expensive.

However, the performance is valuable for anyone with allergies. By the time my filters are changed, there is noticeable build-up of particles so I know that this is something that we would be breathing in if not for the purifier.

When I think about what our purifier does, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year, I am appreciative for our cleaner air and decreases allergy reactions. The cost of the filter, changed twice a year, is approximately $0.45/day. For me, and my family, this is a good deal!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Love these pillows! What a great value for two. Every bed should have these. By the way, Bed, Bath and Beyond sells covers for these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"A nice idea that my daughter loved, too bad the quality was so poor that it couldn't even last through its Second Use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This product works just as described! Will fold your shirt just like you see in the department stores. Super easy and doesn't take any more time than folding without it. Allows a tighter fold so you can store more in one space. I put off buying this and wish I had bought it a lot sooner.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have used electric pressure cookers in the past and each one has died within the first year of use when the electronics simply went haywire.  I've wanted to try a stove top model but was hesitant remembering the behemoth my mother used to use.

As soon as I saw the Clipso by T-fal, I knew that it would be the model that I would get the most use out of.  It is large enough for my needs without being too large.  The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Decent design, but a little bit too small for me. It should work great for people on a diet."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,not as sturdy as i had expected. wobbles. it does the job though.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Hard to find smaller food quality glasses. This my second set.  I mixed them with the fleur de lis design.  Perfect size cocktail glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Wonderful!!!!! Great size, throw them in the dishwasher - these area GREAT!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This thing is quality. The weight is perfect, just heavy enough to prove its granite, but not too heavy. It grinds things to a pulp! There is some dust when you first use it, but just grind itself under water for a little while, let it dry out, and you are good to go."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"American made! Love that, now I just need the matching measuring cups"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Easy pan to flip Really great nonstick. I would have liked a few more recipes but it seems to be more intuitive than stick to a precise recipe. Just learn a method and change it up according to what you want to use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is perfect to get press the liquid out of tofu. I love this thing. No more wasting lots of paper towels or putting something heavy on to the brick of tofu. You will have to tighten the screws for another 10 minutes after the First 15 mins. This press is amazing!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This was a great investment. Kept all salads cold during the day and did not take up alot of room like using a baby pool would.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I really wantes to like these...and was excited for meal prep. I received the package quickly HOWEVER I am extremely disappointed. I paid $17.95 after reading reviews saying these were sturdy containers...one of mine came broken. Keep in mind there are six, I have not used them..I took them out and washed them with lukewarm water and soap and got to the last bottom container and it was BROKEN. This is ridiculous for having paid so much money. ..I was better off with the cheaper kind for 8 bucks. I want a replacement!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I don't often right reviews but I'm so impressed by the quality of this body pillowcase that I have to let everyone know! Just washed it and it washed & dried well. Taupe is a beautiful brown beige with a sateen sheen. I'm going to purchase the sage as these colors work well with my home decor.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,These were really fun for an Alice and Wonderland themed party.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is a great cooker. It is making me fatter. Easy to clean and lighter than traditional crock pots.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Classic, sturdy and functional.  Perfect for keeping honey at room temperature."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Love it but too small.  Would love in larger size
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The glass was busted when I got it. Thankfully I did not need the glass for my project. The frame is good, but a bit on the thin side. I used it to make a jewelry holder for my sister and really needed something thicker. If you are using this, just know that it is more low profile, which is PERFECT for tight spaces. It was super cute painted, but looked really nice before hand/natural too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.  All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs. I received mine in exchange for a honest, unbiased review.  My opinions are my own and you can trust if I find fault in a product I will let you know."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Do not believe the ""highlights"" - these are the roughest pillow cases I have ever had.  Plus, they are no larger than the ""regular' ones that come with sheet sets.  I bought them based on the reviews and that they were supposed to be larger and soft...they are neither.

I am a little shocked because the reviews were so good.  Do keep in mind I am highly sensitive and perhaps a ""normal"" person would think these are soft...but size...I laid them out on top of the other pillow cases I own and there is no difference at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Only down side... is the rail isn't very tall, but that could be due to the mattress that almost didn't fit. I just put a body pillow by the rail in case he wants to squirm off.
Aside from that, I didn't want a traditional bed taking up unnecessary space. Don't have a lot of money so this was a perfect buy. Came with everything it needed, was easy to assemble. Doesn't look cheap either"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"An amazing rice cooker.  More expensive than most others, but well worth the cost if you use it regularly!  I've used it for rice and steel cut oats.  Hope to experiment with legumes and soups in the future.  Highly recommended!  Also strongly recommend a companion cook book to get the most out of the rice cooker.  Delighted to have purchased this for my kitchen and use it almost every day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"It looks very nice, but it feels very cheap. Not heavy, 3 year old gave me a scare when he opened all of the drawers and this thing fell forward thank goodness the room is narrow and the bed managed to save him it landed on bed. Anyway If this is for a kids room get something sturdy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Nice to see that some things are still made in America. I had a Swing-A-Away that lasted for  years but, finally gave up the ghost. In looking around for a replacement I was disappointed to see literally everything MIFC (I think you get the meaning). Luckily, I stumbled across this product on Amazon. It's heavy duty and well made-should last for years.

It's not perfect, though. The handles are bulkier than the Swing-Away. And, it doesn't work very well on flat aluminum cans-the kind that kipper snacks come in (I ended up crushing one of these cans in attempting to open it-I had a real mess). Overall, I still think it's a great, well made product that I would recommend."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"What more can you ask?  The thermometer is accurate, my oven isn't.  I cook a lot better when I know what temp my ever fluctuating oven is.  This is easy to read, and it hangs off the oven rack so it doesn't get in the way.

I have Prime, so it arrived quickly.  When I purchased this it was even less expensive than comparable thermometers at my local store.  I like this one because the dial is larger and easier to see.

After several months it is still running strong.

I hope my review has been helpful for you."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is very pretty and looks extremely real.  For the price, you can't beat this item.  It's actually a bit larger than I thought it might be, which is a good thing from my perspective.  It took a bit longer to get to me but that may have been due to weather issues.  Don't hesitate to get this.  My entire home is Oriental motif and this fits in beautifully...and no worries about trying to keep a real bonsai alive, which can be quite a challenge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.
Note: I had misplaced the instruction notice, and could not read the one posted on their website. I contacted Hoover, a very nice man answered and very courteously sent me a new one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Bottom line? They do the job, look nice and for little out of pocket and I'd buy em again. Recommended.

I have a decent system, certainly not high end. I just upgraded from my all-in-one handmedowns to some Polk bookshelves and needed some flat stands. Easy to build (25 mins) and they do the trick. Nothing fancy. Would buy again. Some folks complaining about cracked wood. Just don't use power tools or over tighten. And yes, the cord system is a bit of a joke. But easy to hack if you're concerned."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I had my local honey stored in a mason jar but it was so messy with the basic ring cap. Every time I tried to get a spoonful it made a mess. This is so much cleaner, and popping it into place in the lid was easy. It looks nice sitting on my counter too."

I bought this one as an addition to the one that came with the set, because it's the most useful size and I decided that I wanted 2 this size for my cooking."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This DII Halloween Skeleton table runner looks really cool. I am using in the classroom when we study the human skeleton system or during Halloween week. However it came wrinkled, so I need to iron it prior to use and will likely hang it up a wall or in front of a book shelve. Also, I prefer that the tablecloths have a polyester blend to it so that they do not shrink in the dryer or wrinkle so easily and apparent. This is slightly see through and has only one stitching, so don't expect to last long, at-least wash it in the gentle cycle."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is a must have for any kitchen. I had my previous splatter screen for so long and one day the screen just fell out. I saw this 3-Pack and just had to have it. The product is lightweight, good quality, and protects very well. Also a good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.

I use mine for some small quantities of baking needs, but am buying the .5 quart version because the squares are not quite what I had in mind as they are very shallow and wide. That is not the fault of the listing, just my visual judgement."

The story is about the crew of the Berenstain Bears and their crewmates, including the two most famous captain, James Patterson, who is an avid reader of science fiction. Patterson is also a strong advocate of the belief that the crew of the Berenstain Bears were not just stupid, but were also dangerous. As a result, Patterson has been in some cases responsible for the deaths of several of the crew members. I don't know if he is the only one who has had a hand in the deaths of many of the crew members, but I have never heard of Patterson before and don't know if I would have been so quick to say this.

When I saw her book, I was just blown away by how beautiful and loving Kate is. The way she presents the story, and the characters, is so touching.

I loved the way she brought me to tears in the first book. I loved how she held me in place and how she touched my heart so deeply. I loved how she had me thinking about the situations that she created. I loved how she had me thinking about her past, about how she was trying to figure out who she was, and how she felt about being with her family. I loved how she showed me how she could not wait to see how things would turn out and to see what would happen next. I loved how she made me feel as though I was being held in the right place at the right time. I loved how she had me on the edge of my seat and the way she had me looking at her.

It was a great ending to this series."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Here's a wonderful book for any fan of Ursula Le Guin. It begins with a foreword by the author in which she outlines each of the stories, most of which take place on worlds of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the cultures may be, however strange their societal structures and customs, Ms. Le Guin uses each tale to underscore what truly unites us and makes us human. These stories comprise the first two-thirds of the book.
As much as I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the worlds of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves characters who have lived their entire lives in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via films and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own rituals and customs with which they structure their lives until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonists who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notions of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at its destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and its destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common as human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world."

It also always seems to rain in ""torrents"" . So much so that London would surely be suffering serious flooding. Also there is less differentiation among characters then there has been in Mr. Higgin's earlier works. I don't believe I will purchase another of his Sean Dillian books.

When they are reunited some 10 years or so later, sparks fly again and the chemistry between them is as strong as ever, but they must learn to let go of past hurts and rediscover each other again.

Francis Perkins, whose politics leaned a bit further left than I personally stand, was nevertheless a thoroughly impressive female leader in a setting where outright hostility and malevolence based on gender alone was not only accepted but seemingly encouraged.  Ms. Perkins' sublime way of sidestepping blustering male counterparts and outwitting (and outworking) male adversaries whilst earning stolid loyalty and respect from open-minded men of the day remain admirable and shocking to a woman born in the late 20th century.  This is a great read!"

With her history of actually living in the White House, she has more knowledge of the ins and outs of the beltway and surrounding areas.

I wanted to love this book too.  I did like it at first.  I just think it is so un-plausable that  someone who had more money than God, could give it up and not be a lot more mad about losing it.  I did like the excerpts of the ""Holly Rollers"", her children novel's.  There were parts that were funny, but most the time I thought it was just trying to hard.  Kristan Higgins is very talented and I love the humor she brings to her novels, this one just wasn't her best work yet."

I imagine most of us who are more amused than confused by the many Nigerian scams especially appreciated that subplot.  I truly admired the author for the skillful and purposefully methodical steps ultimately leading up to the grand finale.  Laura did strain my ability to believe a bit, but she still was basically an effective character.

Action fans may well skip this one, but those of us wanting literature that's meaningful will cherish this volume."
Books_5,4.0,OR,This book is great. And even though it takes place in 1938 some things never change like the jealousy she feels towards Eve even though they're bffs. I didn't pick up on whom she married and had to go back and read that part and there really was no clue aside from the name. I really didn't understand why Tinker just left and felt that could've been explained better. But I really liked the descriptions of New York and all the places that aren't there anymore. I had no idea the subway pictures were real or would've paid more attention to them.
Books_5,1.0,OR,Just a bit strange and different for me. Probably excellent for others.
Books_5,3.0,OR,"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.

There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.

The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.

There is a real romance in there!  I did warm up towards Wulfgar. The characters did seem more believable and sympathetic towards the middle of the story. Towards the late middle to the end I could not put it down."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Sometimes hard to follow and read, I think due to the translations. It was creative an wonderful story following ""the white wolf"" and also reviewing his memories. The characters and are fun and inventive. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes a like fantasy fiction."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I liked both Taylor and Lucas. Lucas was a strong, honorable man from the west and Taylor was a fine lady who wasn't only what she appeared to be. I really enjoyed the story and felt there was a lot of action in this one. I was a bit annoyed by both Taylor's and Lucas's reluctance to confide in each other and their ridiculous resistance to the marriage, but I do understand it was expected due to their backgrounds. I wish we'd been able to meet Lucas's brothers. There was a nice little mention of the Emerald and Black Harry from the Crown's Spies Series. Overall, very nice story."

Because I also had an uncreative instructor that completely relied on this horrific textbook  for the course that used it, I'm an thoroughly disappointed. There is definitely a market for competition here."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I've read two of Homes' books before and loved both of them.  When I read the awful reviews on Amazon, I debated whether to read it or not.  In general, I won't read a book unless it's rated 4 stars and above.  I really enjoyed this book.  The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that I realize that this is not a book for many people.  I enjoyed Harold's ride of life through the book.  I thought he became a pretty good person despite his background and the bad things that happen to him in the book. I think his sex life is totally unbelievable but since I thought this book was filled with comedy, I took the sex sequences as part of the comedy.  I enjoyed the Nixon side of the book because I was around during his presidency and the mess he made of it.  I liked how Harold's life just grew around him, almost without him trying, because he was basically a nice guy.  Most families have some type of dysfunction in them and Harold's family has plenty.  However, who would not care for a sick brother or sick mother?  Who would not care for the other characters that come into Harold's life.  I think Homes has a good insight into our lives and it shows in this good book."
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I have had this story for a few months now and I have started it many times. I just can't finish. I don't find the main characters sympathetic enough to what is going on around them...and for the age the main character is stated to be, I find her immature and rude...thus, why I just can't finish the book. I think the basic plot line is solid, but the characterization just fell short for me."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"The why gives you charisma; the why gives you strength, purpose, and direction; the why separates you from the flock. This idea is undeniably powerful and deserves widespread attention.

Sinek gets to the heart of success by showing the importance of having a higher purpose, or why, behind everything you do. The 200+ pages of the book are elaborations on this single idea. Some might find that length repetitive or overdone, and at times it is; but overall, I found the length helpful in exploring the power and ramifications of the idea.

Considering the fundamental why helps any organization discover its authentic identity, make all decisions on the basis of that authenticity, and project an authentic image to the public. When you have a solid, authentic core, Sinek suggests, decisions are easier and buyers are more attracted to you because you have conviction and you're serving the world for a greater purpose other than merely selling widgets like everyone else.

Starting with why doesn't apply only to business. It applies everywhere, to every project you're working on. It applies to your identity and your life's work. If you think about it, even the greatest artists are those who have had compelling ""why""s.

Alternate titles for the book could be ""The Way of Why"" or, after Eckhart Tolle, ""The Power of Why."" Start with Why is a quick read, yet powerful enough to change your outlook on marketing and persuasion, powerful enough to help you become a more focused and productive person and to help you live a more meaningful life.

The only question: WHY haven't you read it?"
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is my second Kristan Higgins book, and while Ive long grown past reading straight-up romance novels  a staple of my jr. high and high school reading list  someone I trust recommended Higgins to me as smarter and more sarcastic than you average, cloying Harlequin formula and suggested I give her a try.

This is actually a sequel, of sorts, to The Best Man, the other Higgins novel I read, where it focuses on the romance of a side character from that novel in the same quirky upstate New York town. (Apparently, there are also several others featuring the same group of friends and family which Higgins has dubbed, The Blue Heron Series.)

Not quite as sharp as the Best Man, it did follow a similar path, with stubbornly single bar owner Colleen, who loves to set up everyone else, but resists falling in love herself after being badly burned by a former flame. And guess who happens to show up in Colleens bar one day? Yep, the one that got away, Lucas.

This isn't groundbreaking, and it gets to same destination as youd expect from a romance title, but Higgins does it with a lot more panache than your average rote, romance author. Witty dialogue, cliche-free conversation and a healthy dose of snark, all combined with a still sweet and, well, romantic romance.

Entertaining and perfect poolside reading, Ive heard the very smart Linda Holmes, of NPR, cite Higgins as one of the few contemporary romance authors she enjoys reading. Id have to agree."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Jules Feiffer is characteristically hilarious in all of his books (like the Man in the Ceiling, for instance), however, this book is more than just hilarity. It is deceptively simple; simple in style, and simple in writing, but Feiffer teaches countless lessons in this book. However, instead of being preachy, he disguises them behind his singular style of ""funniness"". I could cite a hundred of these lessons. For instance, the ""Valley of Vengeance""; the villagers who thought of nothing but ""getting even"" with their neighbours, burning down their house and snatching their stuff. They lived in a veritable paradise but they never looked beyond harming their fellow man, and when Roger showed up as an eagle and introduced laughter and beauty, their lives changed, and they thought less about vengeance and more about harmony.
Also, it has its funny points (which are many), but it is also despairingly tragic at times. I read this book first when I was 8, and it was just a funny book, but having read it again at an older age (16), I understand even more than I saw before. So, if you get a chance, this book is a must.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book was so inspiring as well as riveting.  Jenna has a wonderful talent for being totally honest about her life while at the same time conveying the lessons she's learned with wisdom and maturity.  She also talks a lot about relationships and just how hard they can be and when you really love someone just how much you have to put up with, and sometimes (when it comes to relationships) just when you should walk away.

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

This is definitely the kind of book you could read over again and still gain new insight, not to mention all the beautiful photographs."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""Northanger Abbey"" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance.  But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality.  The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story.  That fiction is just that.

Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends.  She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home -  Northanger Abbey.  Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance).  The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite.  They are wealthy ""English Christians.""

There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners.  Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.

I would recommend this novel."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Okay, it's true.  I love Fannie Flagg books. Her characters are delightful, engaging, and quirky, but always memorable!. This summer, I've been reading some pretty heavy books about WWII, so I needed something light and fun. I turned to Flagg and her book about Elner Shimfissle.  Just from the name of the main character alone, you know you are in for a fun time. Elner touched so many lives for good over the course of her long life that her death, its aftermath, and visit to heaven, make for some laugh out loud reading.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes implausible, humorous books with feel good results and characters."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This historical review of Elisabeth's history as Queen was nowhere near as gripping as her historical novel describing Elizabeth childhood.  Obviously, a real history cannot exhibit the same twists and turns that you can put in a factually-based novel, but this book focused far too much on Elizabeth love life (or lack of it!)  rather than the details of what was a highly political period.

It is a great story with a mix of romance, of what might have been, what could never be, and the regrets we all carry with us through life.  It is about how life changes you and sometimes takes you on a path you may not want to be on, but nevertheless, there you are.

The heart of the story is Nella's love for a young man which she carries all through her life, and can never seem to come to terms with.

I am now a great fan of the author and can't wait to read her other books."
Books_5,5.0,OR,Ms Binchy expresses in the simplest of terms ... The humanness of the ordinary person. It's a fragile embrace that this writer bestows on each character.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Elizabeth Hand is able to do what so many writers strive for -- to emulate Joseph Conrad when he says, ""My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel  it is, before all, to make you see. That  and no more, and it is everything."" This is the most deeply *visual* prose I've read since...well, since Conrad.

With this in mind, one line from the book struck me: ""How many of us can say we've made a new world out of the things that terrify and move us?"" Well,Elizabeth Hand can, anyway. There's not a lazy sentence in this entire book, which is one of the few out there that any writer can read and learn from, and any reader will find a powerful and moving experience. I can't recommend this one too highly."

Michelle Moran did well in bringing the historical characters to life as she always does.  It was an interesting read with enough true facts to inform the reader about ancient Egypt as well. This book really sparked my interest in the current prospects that there may be much more to be found within King Tut's tomb that might relate to Nefertiti.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"If you're a fan of Inkheart and of science fiction or alternate reality, this is the perfect for you. In this alternated world in 1985 in Britain, time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos have been resurrected,) and literature is taken very seriously. People can get lost in poems and stories, and first editions are forged. This is all usual for Thursday Next, a literary detective. But then someone begins kidnapping characters from stories. And when Jane Eyre is kidnapped, Thursday has to track down the villain and go into the novel herself. This is a really great book; playful and wonderful. I loved the world-building in the book, though there were a lot of specialized terms that you had to learn to make sense of the story. Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style. It was straightforward but also had dry humor. And action, but not too much action. Fforde is actually from Wales, I think. This is the first book in the Thursday Next series, which includes Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots, and Something Rotten. *You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews. blogspot."

Reading about the way Kyle grew up and the life he led before becoming a SEAL really gives insight into what sort of person it takes to be a special forces operator. Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a ""good ol' boy"". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing. The autobiography is broken up into chapters with sub-chapters, making for quick easy reading and the tone of the narrative is so laid back that it's really more like having a conversation than reading. I love this book."

I'm glad I didn't know, because I might not have read it. This was my first experience with verse and not something I would have willingly chosen. At first it was a little hard to follow the broken sentences, but when I got used to it I found it so incredibly addictive! There wasn't really anything exciting happening for most of the book, yet I was still engrossed and I devoured the story almost in one sitting.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"INVENTING GEORGE WASHINGTON:  AMERICA'S FOUNDER IN MYTH AND MEMORY is an interesting look into some of the many stories we've all heard about George Washington.  Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myths themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reasons behind their origination.  While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real sources of George Washington quotes and lore that Lengel exposes.

While some were innocent enough embellishments upon actual events or wholly made-up fiction, the reasons behind others are far from innocent.  Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the ends of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delves into the prevelance of the mythology in todays world.

Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writings directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myths retain their seeming veracity.  Whether taken from forged writings of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirers or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these stories in todays modern era--usually to serve modern political ends.

While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion as to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind:  Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify its sourcing.  As to the legends?  Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the hearts of his countrymen.""

I give this book FOUR STARS.  Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington.  Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for stories and qoutes being bandied about today!"

Yet our habits, many would say, rule us. They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.

This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.

A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them.
Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.

The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.

A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring."

I'll give him credit for that, but not much else.  The way Obama grinds though flag officers makes me wonder how much longer the military system will continue to produce the highly competent high level Generals and Admirals we must have to stay safe in a world that seems to hate us for who we are.  Thankfully there are people like Bob Gates who will lead and endure the realities of public life for the sake of our country."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Ahh...such a pretty cover that contains a book that is really nothing special.  But, I've read the Vampire Kisses series by Schrieber, so I was kind of expecting it.

I actually liked Celeste and I liked Brandon.  Celeste is different than the typical teenager in her crowd.  It stands out right from the beginning.  She goes with the flow because it's the easy thing to do.  She didn't want to loose her friends by rocking the boat.  I wasn't surprised by it.  I also liked how Brandon is different.  He doesn't fit it with either crowd.  It's especially interesting when we learn about his life at his previous school.  I also like the chemistry between Celeste and Brandon, that is until it got a little over the top.  It's like an inevitable part of teen fiction sometimes.

I wasn't particularly found of Celeste's friends.  They seemed so shallow.  And Nash was just not likable at all.  I was expecting a love triangle type of things.  But, Nash was hard for me to swallow.  I also didn't really like the town divided thing.  It just didn't work with the story in my eyes.  The actual legend of the werewolf was different.  It was really tame compared to other stories.  But, then again it fits into the author's idea of vampires in her other series.

So, will I read the next one?  I'm not sure.  This was ok, but it didn't really stand out in any way.  But, the author's other series did get progressively better with each book, so I might give the next installment a go."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"ISBN 034536161X - Back to books related to WWII and religious artifacts. As a group, these books are interesting if only for the complete effect - from Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders to The DaVinci Code to Indiana Jones, the differences and similarities in the tales are fascinating. Indy begins the book by closing out his nearly lifelong chase after the Cross of Coronado. Ready for a return to the academic life, he returns late for the school year, only to find that his father is missing. Henry Jones has his own lifelong chase nearing an end - he appears to be within sight of the Grail Cup, and there are several groups of people who will do anything to beat him to it. Nazis, Henry's assistant Elsa, and a secret Brotherhood all have their eyes on the same prize, for their own reasons. Who will reach it first isn't nearly as important as who will be allowed to claim it. As adventure books on the subject go, The Last Crusade is an odd mix of lightheartedness and murder, which detracts from the excitement of the story in the book but played well in the movie. Overall, though, it's a nice adaptation of the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I liked it. I didn't love it.

After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There was an entertaining main character, lots of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem was that I didn't connect with the main character.

Harry was so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what was inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry.

On a couple of occasions in the book, Harry claims to struggle with his choices. He wants to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draws him toward darker things. I know about these struggles because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much as a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation was lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy.

Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away. I will read the second book in this series though, and I hope to see Harry making some tough decisions that show me the darkness he claims is inside him."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I have learned a little bit with this book, but she spends far too much time justifying science rather than elucidating it. It comes off quite defensive, and a bit annoying While I am interested in the LHC and have learned a lot about it, it is not why I wanted to buy the book. I am struggling to finish it. While it is well read, I give it a 'meh'."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Love love love love love! Honestly, it's rare that I read a split time book and like both the historical and contemporary storylines equally. usually I end up loving the historical story so much more. But this time, I'm so happy to say I adored both! And the way both storylines are woven together near the end. ahhhh, so good. Love the writing, love the characters. Birdie, especially! And I can't help loving the way Tenley's storyline so perfectly captured the not-so-glittery side of being a writer."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"The story begins at a skating rink where a young girl pulls a gun on another teen and a standoff involving the police ensues. It sets off a chain of events that goes into a direction I didn't expect.

It's an awful, uncomfortable story that Slaughter tells masterfully. My emotions were all over the place, especially where Lena is concerned. By the end, I couldn't believe my feelings of sympathy for her, an amazing feat. Her soliloquy near the end was extraordinary. There were a number of themes resonating strongly, most loudly was the fragility of children's faith in the adults entrusted with their care.

The narration was a bit uneven, at times wonderful and at others, it felt like she was just reading.

While the subject matter is tough, its honest and realistic presentment was compelling. I'm pulling for Lena but I know she's going to disappoint me 100 times throughout this series. And that's impressive storytelling."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"As an avid reader I have been pretty disappointed lately by the newer books and how boring they are or how bad the ending is. This book did not disappoint. I am giving this book 5 stars, the characters were very developed and I felt like I could easily visualize them and they weren't unrealistic. The story itself is good with lots of turns and I was left guessing MANY times. This was not a predictable mystery which I really liked and which made me keep wanting to read to know what happened. I felt it did have a couple dry parts or parts that SEEMED repetitive, but those parts were quickly redeemed. I would highly recommend this book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, but I never knew it was a book until I found it on Amazon. I just finished reading it to my 4 year old, and we both really enjoyed it. It is well written and exciting, but not too scary. I highly recommend it. It's a short book for adults, but a great length for children."
Books_5,3.0,OR,The author could have gone into more depth about covert bigotry.  THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.  The author should be commended for presenting the bigotry on the part of Muslim's and that it cuts both ways.  Maybe more depth would have been possible if not as much time was spent on the grieving that takes place after you lose your spouse.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Kristin Hannah is among my most favorite authors. This story is among her most unusual subjects. Very interesting. I love this era and I have read many books about the war, the people, the horror of it all and yet war has such a romantic aura about it . ""The Nightingale "" does not disappoint. It gave me yet another bit of insight into that terrible war against humanity. I would recommend this book to my friends."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"An absolutely fascinating book, very readable. Perfect book for anyone who loves nature, my husband and I were so inspired by this book that we took a vacation to see the trees and hike some of the areas described in this book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Devon & Georgina (Gina) are a remarkable couple. She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.

Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him. Their back and forth romance is fraught with both tension and delight, and is thoroughly satisfying.

Despite a couple of minor question marks (like not signing the marriage agreement before the wedding), this is a thoroughly enjoyable read."

Books_5,4.0,OR,Syn is all man....the story line made me angry with shar but it really was a great read....interesting. Read the preview of the book before purchasing. If it grabs you purchase one and read and then decide if you want to continue.  This is the only way you would appreciate the book.
Books_5,5.0,OR,I read this book years ago and I still find myself talking about it and recommending to friends. It is a wonderful story and reminds us that not everyone sat by and did nothing during the holacaust. Many people risked their lives to do the right thing. I recommend this book highly.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is the epic story of one woman's journey to find knowledge and understanding about her own life but also for the world we live in. The book is beautifully written with dozens of unique characters that she meets during the eighty plus years of her life. The book actually starts with her dad as a young boy as he moves from humble origins in England to become one of the richest men in America by utilizing his knowledge of Botany to make profits. But, the book is much more than this. This book covers a full range of human emotions from humor to intense sorrow  - but what ties this book together is the heroine's quest for knowledge and understanding. I recommend this book in particular to people who have an innate sense of curiosity about the wondrous world we live in."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Girls (3 and 5) LOVE these books. This one is very detail oriented and they love the pictures. I was actually surprised at how long it was!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Such a tumultuous time, not just for the country, but for any one at that ended age between child and adult. The mystery of the record and what could be inspire the reader to find hope in any situation."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I appreciate this book on so many levels, I don't know where to even start this review. The Life List by Lori Nelson Spielman is a study of a person's transformation from a life being led to a life worth leading. The journey, however, is not without its own set of trials and tribulations.

When we meet Brett, the main character, she is the picture of success with the entire package of successful trappings: friends, love, professional achievement, and a life in the great city of Chicago.  It is only when Brett's mother passes away from cancer that the layers begin to peel away and we see what's going on beneath the surface.

To further exacerbate the situation, Brett is fired from her job by a sister-in-law who receives a promotion in the family business that had been promised to Brett. Through a series of events, it comes to Brett's attention that it was, in fact, her mother who has orchestrated some of the events Brett is being forced to deal with. The biggest and seemingly most undoable is for Brett to look back on a list of goals she made when she was just 14 and as is stipulated by her mother's attorney, in order to receive the inheritance from her mother, she must complete ten of the items on the list immediately. Dealing with the list and some of the goals penned as a young girl seems, well, difficult and impossible (get a horse?) particularly since she is in a state of grief.

Working through the list at first is challenging but watching her grow and evolve as she tackles each item, is miraculous, amidst surprise upon surprise but I will leave those surprises to be discovered by the reader.

I really enjoyed this and am sure others will too.

Recommend."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"The original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' published in 1855 contained twelve poems only. The subsequent editions beginning in 1856 were to greatly expand the work. Thus I would recommed that anyone who wishes to know the true range of Whitman's work find another selection of his work of which there is a larger share of his great work.
Whitman is the poet who Emerson prophesied, the American visionary poet who sang of the complex greatness of the society, and connected his own soul with its expansive facts of life."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I thought this was a fantastic fantasy read. There's not a ton of surprises, everything seems pretty spelled out along the way so if you don't pick up on the hints on who really is the Black Knife then you must not been paying attention. Maybe the ending or Patrick's declaration for where he sees Wil and him in the future was the only plot surprises. I think having secret identities in stories makes for a fun read. The wraith took me a bit to understand exactly how that plays out to be the enemy. The magic system could have been explained more. I'm starting The Mirror King right away so no big cliffhanger wait for me to find out what happens."
Books_5,4.0,OR,I have a junior literature class and this book was good for them to read because it was high interest without being to wordy and difficult.  It was good to teach because of the underlying peer pressure with a very charismatic boy.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Novel was fast-paced, intermingling suspense, mystery and drama. Bosch's Holmeseque skills certainly did magic to the novel's realism."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Very involved!  Page turner and informative about Brian, his son!!!  I love the Michael Bennett series and all of the Family as well as Mary Catherine!!!  Cant wait for the next book in this series!"
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I mildly enjoyed Last Licks, but none of the subsequent books in this series have come up to the very first one -- The Big Kitty.  The charm of this book, and both of the other books in the series, are the sections where Shadow, the cat, is narrating.  Ms. Donally does know cats -- I will concede that.  She has not made Shadow a super, magical cat with human intelligence.  He's just a cat, with cat-like concerns about food, hunting, and female cats!  The mystery in Last Licks is so-so, and I wasn't sure about the culprit until the end.  But, character development is sadly lacking.  There isn't that spark between Sunny and her cop boyfriend that is so well done by Sofie Kelly in her Magical Cats mysteries.  Unless Ms. Donally picks up the pace, I don't think I will pay to read any more in this series."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Once again the Mess Woods book opens more questions than she answers. In this second novel the Incorrigible Children are brought to London, the rest is a merry chase."
Books_5,5.0,OR,If you think small town living is safer than big cities think again.  THis is the story of two innocent girls who went to the grocery store and never returned home.  The were picked up by two local teenagers raped and then thrown over a 150 foot bridge. The story pulls you in never lets go. If this tale wasn't documented you would think it was written by Clive Barker. five stars for one the best true crime stories ever published.  Ask Ann Rule she will tell you.  Why are still reading this review?  Buy the book!!
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent book. Written with a lot  of fact and real knowledge. The author was a Catholic priest who had a lot to do with this subject. I've read this book a few times, and every time, I get really creeped  out. This book is not fiction, and you can tell.  I always come away with a desire to keep up my prayer life and keep going to mass. I'm going to look for his other books."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"I had heard that Kindle books can be lent. Only a few of them apparently. It is ridiculous that my wife should now have to buy this book again to be able to read it on her device.

If you go to this link, you can learn about lending Kindle books, including how to tell whether it is lendable BEFORE you buy it.

This will dramatically reduce the number of Kindle titles I purchase.

I hope Amazon is reading....."
Books_5,4.0,OR,It was a good period story and a good read and rendered good conversation.  Our book club is varied ages and from all over the country and England.  It was fun to hear what was going on with everyone during that era.
Books_5,4.0,OR,Good book especially if you're interested in the early days of the Pacific War.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I read it in a couple of hours.  Albom presents a ""heaven"" without a God and without joy.  I found it trite and depressing.  As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."
Books_5,5.0,OR,Great book about the end of WWII in the Pacific and the dropping of the atomic bomb and the decision leading to that.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I'm not a critic, but I really enjoyed this book. Also liked ""A Time to Kill"" which introduced the characters in this story. You could read this as a stand alone, but I would read A Time to Kill first to get to know some of the characters."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I read this book in two days and could hardly put it down. Good for a ssymmer read. I live all Nora Roberts books.

Books_5,4.0,OR,Each one in the series just gets better.  A wonderful  escape from the doom and gloom headlines of every day life.  Ladybug Farm is a seven book series and I already know I'll be suffering separation anxiety when I'm done with them all.  Off to the next one:)
Books_5,4.0,OR,So many facts of a time in the UK if done differently could have lost the war and of the man  who saw it so clearly and was right. Well worth the time to read.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Great story with characters who stay consistent, yet grow throughout the series. Fun magical adventures in a well-written story capture the imagination."
Books_5,5.0,OR,One of my favorite series. I will be very sad when this series ends.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"If this book does not make you laugh, check your pulse.

Lots of fun.  Great for the whole family."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"While I saw the movie before listening to the audiobook, I must say that I still really enjoy the main character. He's one of those guys you love to hate, but he's trying so hard to do the right thing, even if it means defending a scumbag who deserves a lot worse. Of course, since I had seen the movie already, I had an idea how it was going to end, but couldn't remember the specifics. Perhaps thats a measure of a great crime drama: all the misdirection makes it difficult to know whodunit, allowing future rereads to be enjoyable.

But, back to the main character, Mickey Haller, I think one of the reasons this book was a breeze to listen to was because the main characters POV is so well written. You can tell that he has some baggage from his father, which is partly why he defends everyone, regardless if they're guilty or not. The fact that Haller knows his way around the legal system and uses it to his advantage to even get the guilty an innocent ruling just shows that he takes pride in his work, even if it labels him as someone who keeps the crime on the streets.

The plus to this audiobook was also the narrator, who was awesome in bringing all the different characters to life with his voice acting. Even if the story is told from the point of view of the eponymous Lincoln Lawyer, there are plenty of interesting people in this book, and each one certainly has a different sound to them. Its the attention to these details that differentiates a narrator just reading a book to you and a voice actor who can bring the events happening in the words hes speaking to life.

A great start to an interesting crime drama series, I give The Lincoln Lawyer 4.0 stars out of 5."
Books_5,5.0,OR,My grandchild loves horses and Dr. Suess books. This is a hit with both and poor Robert's dilemma. Snuggle with a child you love and enjoy this fun book!
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I chose this book as we've recently traveled throughout the west. Though I found the storyline interesting, the story itself seemed slow moving. I was not drawn to return to the story and so the reading dragged out. I just don't feel I ever connected with the writer's voice. I am pleased to know that many of the characters were based on actual people of the era."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I couldn't put this book down. The characters were so alive, I felt I knew them all. They each had a love story to tell, not able to lose the past love (er) they lost. Each is searching for answers and sharing their losses and finding new love. And if you love books this trip along the waterways of France will entice you to pick up those books we meant to read but have not. The idea Monseiur. Purdu has of finding a book that suits one reader and not another, and the way he shelves his books is very interesting The descriptions of the sights and people they see on their trip to discovery is the best travelogue of this type of travel I have ever read. Books, romance, dreams, self-realizatios all packed into the best book ever."

I will definitely want to read it several times to absorb the enormous amount of information that Lugavere and Grewal give the reader.  A must book for those who want to live their best for as long as they want."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This I read for the book club I'm in and it sounded great, but then when I first got it I was a little overwhelmed at the size, I think because it was a hardback and so large. But I found I enjoyed it all the way through, the characters are real and have flaws, very humans ones at that considering they are not. Great turn of the century novel."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Jesse Kellerman seems to be getting better with each book he puts out.  THE GENIUS was much better that TROUBLE, which was much better than SUNSTROKE.  I enjoyed the originality of the story line and, as flawed a character as Ethan was, I really liked him a great deal.

My only criticism is that the ending, while not bad, was a bit anti-climatic.  I read this book while I was traveling and it really occupied those boring hours waiting in airports and on planes.  A four star recommendation for this one."

The line from ""The Gathering"" about the bagpipers relating that the trilling of the chanters above the drones ""made the blood itch"" made me stop  and read again and again. It is the finest description I have read. I feel my skin shivering at the thought."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I loved LaCour's Hold Still and boy did I love this one too! Colby is such a great narrator. He loves Bev, she has been his best friend since forever and he can't wait to go on tour with her all girl band, The Disenchantments, before he and Bev tour Europe. They have decided not to go to college like everyone else. The other band members are Alexa(younger sister to Meg and still in high school) and Meg (will be dropped off to college at the end of the band's tour )while Colby is the driver of his uncle's prized Melinda, set-up guy and go to guy for everyone. He is an awesome artist, so is Bev, which makes it even more difficult when Bev acts very strange at the start of the tour and tells Colby she applied to RISD and will attend in the fall!!! Colby is stunned because Bev gives him no explanation, but Meg and Alexa make him feel great. They go to some interesting stops on their tour, get involved in trying to solve a tattoo mystery, and meet some ""different"" people, places, etc. There were so many great quotes, Colby SEES things and his comments are insightful, thoughtful, yet you know he is clamoring to find some meaning in this tour and what should he do now that they are not going to Europe. The more I found out about Colby's friends and what made them unique, LaCour's writing, setting, characters were all so memorable. I am not into tattoes, still am not after reading this book, but I do like the murals and graffiti artistry."

Books_5,5.0,OR,Another great book!!! Dated during my growing up years but the story line is very interesting. Hope to read more from the deaf man!!
Books_5,1.0,OR,"One finds out pretty clearly and directly who the murderer is about midway through the book.  At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish.  That requires attention to pacing with matters picking up and slowing down.  That's what made Da Vinci Code such a good read as well Le Carre' novels like Tinker, Tailor.... That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work.  And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr!  Puh-leeze!

Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off.  Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before.  What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"Have always enjoyed very much this authors books, but the ending on this one is a disgrace. Had I known it didn't have an ending, I would not have wasted my money.

Very disappointed , Mr. James Patterson."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"An excellent idea poorly developed. What might be the behaviour of a 3,000 yo human being? Would he/she still behave like all of us? I doubt it. I also doubt anyone could survive for so long since the immortals can be killed as easily as ordinary human beings. Let alone any mad guy who would enjoy doing away with them.

Books_5,5.0,OR,Another hit in the Sigma Force series. Great plot and non-stop action as usual.  I wish I had read all the books in order but it's not a big factor.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"Although the few pages written that involve the main characters were good, there was constant interruptions with the side characters within the book. It was like being at the library and while trying to read a few chapters you were constantly being interrupted by a chatty Cathy. ugh!!  So, with that being said I did read this novella twice, the first time it was every page and I was extremely annoyed and wanted my money back. Then I re-read the few pages that are actually devoted to the main characters and it was enjoyable, but that being said it only took me less than two 1/2 hours to read this twice. Definitely not worth $2."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Native Tongue is an enjoyable book which translates well to riding a train, something I do every day, an hour each way. The story is crafted well enough to keep you interested, the characters are colorful, the underlying message is a decent one, and the book as a whole stands up well as I look back on it. Having said that, there's something in the narrative which makes you wonder about the author, if he's really a homicidal maniac waiting for you to stumble into his back yard.

That statement might sound a bit off-the-wall. I suppose I should admit to having read a magazine article about him recently. The book moves from colorful, with a hint of darkness, to a little edgy for the wrong reasons after you read more about the guy. Still, that shouldn't (and doesn't) take away from the book, which is a good way to pass the time on the train ride into the city.

The story is about man's encroachment on the various Florida lands that should be reserved for wildlife as opposed to, say, condos and parking lots. To be sure, this is an ever-growing problem which looms on society's horizon, only getting bigger by the day. In typical American fashion, the author takes this stand only *after* establishing his own residence in the state. ""Do as I say, not as a do,"" has never been more prevalent.

But the book isn't terribly serious. It's a whimsical fiction story which is easy to chew through at a good pace. Hiaasen is a good writer, and keeps the narrative moving well through the book. A bit peculiar in spots, the story nevertheless runs cohesively from start to finish, pausing occasionally to let you laugh at yet another silly kink in the story's chain.

All in all, a good book that's worth the read. Will definitely buy more of this author's work."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Not a kids' book, but very interesting read.  You have to suspend disbelief for the initial event, but otherwise everything follows naturally. The construction of the story (alternating viewpoints) makes you want--NEED--to keep reading!"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Had zero interest in the subject matter going in but loved the book, nonetheless. A great story, well-told."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"You need to stay with this book as it began slowly for me. At first, I wasn't sure if it was going to be my kind of legal thriller. I'm glad I kept reading.  I fully enjoyed my time with A VERY SIMPLE CRIME.

The author doesn't insert extra words that do nothing to move the story forward and I appreciated his lean style.  At times, it seemed like there were two different writing styles and both engaged and held me.  Really interesting.

A VERY SIMPLE CRIME is a fast and satisfying read.  Grant Jenkins has my interest and I hope to have his next book in my hands soon."

Books_5,2.0,OR,This book is way too long and confusing. It has too many characters and some characters have similar names which makes it even more confusing. It's neither a mystery or a ghost story like it's been described. I just don't understand how it won  the Booker prize.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Very fun, traditional chick lit.  Starts off with a steamy sex scene right at the beginning to hook you in (mmmm....).  Will not disappoint Green's avid fans.  Definitely recommend."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Blood Canticle is neither ""affected"" nor ""whiney."" It's a great book and well worth the money. Though I've never been overly fond of the character of Rowan Mayfair and don't see what Lestat sees in her, I'm glad Anne has brought these two together. (But oh! How I wish she'd write a continuation of The Mummy: Or Ramses The Dammed!) Obviously some people are just put off because she claims this will be her last book about Lestat. I, for one, don't believe that. I think one day she'll be walking down the street, perhaps after doing a little shopping or after a nice meal, and Lestat will pop up and tell her ""Hello, Anne. Have I got a story for you."" Because if there's one thing about Lestat we all know, he can't be shut up."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.

With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door,  it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.

The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parents

I served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.

The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."
Books_5,2.0,OR,"Just didn't hold my interest. I finished it, but it was really a disappointing read."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work.
Give the man a break and give this book a READ...Unless you possess absolutely no sense of humour, you will find it quite enjoyable!"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this book! I adore Julia Quinn's writing style and, while they do tend to get a bit spicy, I simply glide over those passages and enjoy the story itself. Quinn has a way of writing that is just so witty. I find myself smiling and laughing almost all the way through her books - they are lighthearted and yet her characters have a depth to them that make them come alive.

Because of Miss Bridgerton might actually my favorite of all of Quinn's books. I read it in one sitting. I didn't want it to end and now I have to wait for the next Quinn book - that's the only negative side to her books! :)"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This  book deserves a 10. Possibly a 12. It's that good. However, since the rating system seems irrevocably broken I've given it a 4. Because we all know no one trusts a 5.

Another excellent book by Elizabeth Moon. This book plops you right into the lead character's mind. The first time I read this book I was transported into his world. I was thinking in his speech patterns for days afterwards. It's technically science fiction but honestly. I think this book would work well for any category of reader. Well worth the kindle buying price."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is an excellently written book - fast paced and engaging. Jon Krakauer is adept at interweaving the history of the LDS Church with a present day story of ""violent faith"".

Based on a ""revelation"" he received from God, Ron Lafferty and his brother Dan brutally murdered Brenda Lafferty (their sister-in-law) and her 15-month old daughter, Erica. The two brothers never spoke of having remorse for what they did. In fact, Dan openly admits to the murder, claiming God wanted him to do it. It is a haunting notion: that someone's thoughts could be so twisted as to let them believe that by killing another human being they were doing the work of God. Krakauer latches onto this idea and examines exactly what would lead a person to commit murder in present day America because of religious believe.

Though the topic is fascinating, it is important to keep in mind that Krakauer only focuses on the extreme parts of Mormonism. He talks about Fundamentalists who openly practice polygamy and the physical and sexual abuse that goes on in those communities. Not all Mormon's are polygamists and not all Mormon's actively seek ""blood atonement"" against their enemies; it is only a small percentage that is so extreme. Before judging all Mormons too harshly remember, every religion has its radicals. Therefore if you do decide to pick up ""Under the Banner of Heaven"", read it with a grain of salt."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very sad and difficult story to read, but probably one that should be read so as to have understanding of what some people go through. It is well written and thought provoking but doesn't leave one with much hope."
Books_5,5.0,OR,This book is an icon. It melds together the new with the old. I read the book and keyed in on the vast minutia and trivia of the 70s and 80s... my son read it and keyed in on a lot of the modern day tech speak. GREAT BOOK.
Books_5,3.0,OR,"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I loved Steelheart. LOVED it.
Why do all the superhero stories and comics portray those with these superpowers as ""good"" and moral?"" Brandon Sanderson takes this supposition and turns it on its head by giving the super-powered in Steelheart's universe one side to be on -- the bad side. They are the villains and those without powers have either accepted it and given up or are doing their best to fight back. I loved the story and look forward to what Sanderson comes up with next."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier works.  Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warriors from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  ""gwali.""  The princes of the realm are handsome and heroic, their  princesses beautiful and spirited.  The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a storyline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight or substance to the  tales, and harbor some doubts that the ""Riftwar Saga"" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests. Nonetheless I  will admit that so far Feist's stories do offer facile moments of unadorned  diversion and amusement."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Mr. Barzun, has on page 739 attempted to define novels as opposed to tales. He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about ""detective tales"" seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a ""tale"", i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I really enjoyed this book.  I am glad I have a new series to read. Well written and it keeps you interested.
Books_5,5.0,OR,This series of publications cannot be beat if you want to delve deep into the Bard's plays but have hesitated because of the old English. You read the new then the old and now you get it! After a while you find that you hardly need the translation any more.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"My highest compliment to a book is when I don't want to put it down - and that's how I felt about this book!  It was interesting from beginning to end.  The characters were believable with mostly realistic situations. The ending seemed a little forced with some unresolved issues--the chase and action on the bridge seemed forced and the whole Gill situation needed resolution.  Also the relationship between Randall with the sons could have been better developed.

It was a good story and kept my interest."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is just a quick review you can read my long and full review on my blog [...]
I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to be a part of a wonderful story that will continue to grow as Robb writes more books. This story is a well-known formula that still hold true to making an amazing story. The mystery and build up are on par you cannot go wrong. This story will be just as relevant in 5 years as it is today that is the power of good storytelling and being able to set a story setting that the background that stays immersive but without making it over saturated. I am a believer of her stories and so far there has not been one I have not enjoyed I enjoy seeing how she helps shape the characters with each story allowing us to feel like we are growing along with them."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a good beginning textbook.  It is still being used in an online college where I tutor even though there are several more recent
editions.  I actually now have 3 different editions for different colleges and find them mostly the same.  Certainly if you want a book for personal use, this a bargain."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book is laugh out loud funny.  The simple drawings add wonderful,  ridiculous understanding of the events being described in Allie Brosh's unique voice.  One of the most poignant descriptions of what it is like for a brilliant mind to be haunted by depression.  She still manages to make the subject entertaining."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"The essence of a good novel is its ability to whisk you away to a place where you would not normally go. Linda Collison does such a thing wonderfully in her debut novel, Star-Crossed. Patricia Kelley sets out in 1760 from her paupered but privileged place in English society to claim her dead father's only estate asset, a sugar plantation in Barbados. Stowing away on a boat, she is first moonstruck by a bosun's mate, Brian Dalton, but then faces the dilemma of choosing Dalton's love or marriage's security with a more sensible choice to marry the ship's doctor, MacPherson. The entire story swings many times like a pendulum between this two contrary choices.

Along the cruise, readers are exposed to life on several English navy ships are Patricia travels with Dalton and/or MacPherson to various Caribbean locales in changing circumstances. As she literally rides the staterooms by day and the yardarms by night, her life takes equally polar changes that can be sensually experienced by those wishing to join her on the page. Her final destination satisfies both her heart and her head.

A thoroughly enjoyable story."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"THe reviewer who said s/he didn't like Picasso and felt this book was Picasso-esque provided, I think, the most accurate and succinct description of this book. However, unlike the other reviewer, I enjoy Picasso's cubism and expressionistic figures, and I was moved by this book.

I found that it was important to read every word, because if I read to quickly and skipped over words and sometimes sentences, I missed important moments in the book. I had to re-read the last 5 pages to make sense of the ending. Reading every word of a novel can be taxing - and many novels don't warrant a close reading. But this one does."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nothing to Lose is vintage Jack Reacher.  This time he's in Colorado, heading to San Diego from Calais, Maine.  The locals there pronounce it 'callous' and that speaks to part of Jack's character, the part that arises when he's challenged unnecessarily.  The 'challenger' here is Despair, CO, a few miles from Hope, CO, a few miles from Halfway, CO.  Despair is a company town.  It's also a pivotal element of the classic western plot in which the hero stumbles upon a boondock town in which everyone, especially the law, conspires against him.  The law in this case tells Jack to depart, forthwith, and for no apparent reason.  Jack is not one to follow irrational orders, particularly from individuals with no authority over him, and he sets out to discover the secret(s) of Despair, with the help of a policewoman from Hope.

Lee Child's new novel points up his almost unique ability to take a simple plot with simple elements and turn it into a compelling, irresistibly insistent narrative.  By the time we reach the end we discover that things are far less simple than they appear.  They are also a bit too complex for plausibility's sake, but by then we are caught up in the wave and are carried to the powerful conclusion.

Another strong outing for Jack.  While perhaps not his strongest, it is stronger than whatever's in second place.  Highly recommended."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Overall, I enjoyed the story. Some of the details/actions were not consistent with the time period. Also, while I think flawed characters make for much better stories, there are better ways to write in the ""flaws"" than having an antagonist point them out at every opportunity. Also, the attempt at romantic tension between the heorine and the male character grated on my nerves. The male character was presented, first to last, as an insufferrable jerk, though the implication was that he's really just misunderstood. He's being an ass to push her away because he really wants to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx....  SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future books by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery readers turning pages. Just, please, drop the annoying romance sterotypes, there are better ways to develop intimacy, meaningful and realistic connections, between characters. (A little more research on the crime element of the time period might help too)."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This wasn't the best Robin Cook I've ever read, it wasn't even the best Robin Cook with Jack and Laurie as main characters.  But it did keep me flipping the pages to get to the climax.  Unfortunately the ending seemed a bit contrived and the non-New York characters were poorly developed.  I didn't notice so much with the characters from the medical examiner's office in New York because most of them have been in other Cook novels I've read.
Still and all the premise of the book was enough to keep me reading.  I was not totally comfortable with transgenic technology before I read the book, now I'm even less comfortable."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book is definitely not a ""bit of light reading for your spare time"", but it is very difficult to find a biological concept that they do not cover in this book.  This is the book we use in AP Bio.  What makes it difficult is the fact that there is so much chemistry, but that is by nature of the fact that you take chemistry the year after bio, not anything that has to do with the book.  This book makes biology fun and interesting.  It has detailed explainations of things and gives clear, colorful diagrams that are very useful.  You could use this book as a biology encyclopedia or use it to teach yourself any topic pertaining to bio.  I would really recommend at LEAST a year of high school chemistry before taking this class if you don't want to stress yourself out trying to learn the chemical topics they present to you.  Not that they don't do a good job, it can just be too much though."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I am no longer a part of the YA age group. In fact I ignored my husband and children to read this series. I love them, and can't wait to read them with my kids when they are older.  The series is one of the best written in terms of showing the emotion and thoughts that happen with first love.  One of the great things that I appreciate about Eclipse is the way they discuss and work to maintain moral boundries while showing the turmoil that happens with temptation.  I love the story lines.  I woudn't be surprised to find Bella and Edward in my address book, that is how real these characters have become. I can't wait for Stephenie's upcoming books to be released! I even bought this series, which is a rarety for me!  I can't believe I can rave about a book about vampires.  The book is actually about differences, and we all have those in our relationships.  Great series.  Start with the first one, and work up to Eclipse to get the full effect."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"A good novel of WW2, focusing more on the countryside -- small villages and farms -- and the views of their inhabitants and the unknown brainwashing they encountered. Also gave insight into the resistance vs. the Nazi followers, the nobility vs. the commonfolk, as three women's stories unfold. Not the caliber of The Nightengale or Beneath a Scarlet Sky, but an engaging novel from a somewhat different perspective. Wished there had been more ""action"" or ""suspense."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Outliers is classic Gladwell. Well researched, impeccably storied and logically concluded. He takes us on journey after journey relating facts and experiences and tying them together in fresh ways to achieve new understanding of the complexities of life. Some are deceptively simple - you need 10000 hours of practice at anything to be truly proficient. Some more complex - cultural differences have huge bearing on how good you are at something. I loved it. It made me think and change my perceptions of schooling, genius and hard work. Thoroughly recommended."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience.  Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life.  The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!

I think this book has been an excellent investment for me, and I hope it is for many of you too."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"A wonderful book that led to a long conversation with my child.  Beautifully written and illustrated, the story tells a simple tale attacking materialism and promoting charity, that is perfectly written so as to turn to your childen and say, ""what was that story about.""  In a consumeristic age, and a culture where the relatives dump endless supplies of plastic stuff on the kids, this book sends a good counter message about the meaning of life."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"As always this was a great book, I was worried because after reading the second book I thought that it was the last book and felt it had a good ending, so I wondered how this book would go. But it was great, I loved that they had their problems, but they always stayed together. Gabriel was great as always, he has been my number one book boyfriend since day one, and he did not disappoint. However, it must be said that I did not feel like this had a proper ending, I felt like so many things were left open, without giving too much away, we got caught up on a lot of the secondary characters, like Rachael, Simon, Crista, Tom, but I felt like ALL of their stories were left open, and I finished the book thinking uhh well how does their story end??? Maybe the author felt like the story was about Gabriel and Julia and they didn't need to be answered, or maybe it was left open on purpose for a book four, I don't know, but I would have liked to know how their story ended as well. Other than that, loved the book, has been one of my favorites since I first picked it up."

Books_5,5.0,OR,The illustrations in this book are absolutely stunning.  I've been a big fan of Harry Potter since the first time I read it in 4th grade so I had high hopes for this book.  It certainly did not disappoint.  The level of detail that Jim Kay gives to the illustrations is breathtaking.  This would make a perfect gift for anyone that loves the world of Harry Potter.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"If you're a fan of John Sandford's books featuring Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers - as I am - you will like the latest from Sandford featuring Virgil Flowers the, rural Minnesota version of his Twin Cities boss, Lucas Davenport. Deadline has small-town official corruption on a grand scale and on a parallel plot track, dog-napping on a grand scale. Lots of interesting characters and of course, Virgil Flowers solving both crimes in his own style of brilliant sleuthing, folksy investigation and his endless fascination with fishing Minnesota lakes and rivers with just enough romance to give him a very human quality. All in all, a fun read written as only John Sandford can."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Reginald Hill was for many years my absolutely favorite mystery writer. His death in 2012 shocked me deeply. I spent many happy hours with Dalziel and Pascoe, Joe Sixsmith and numerous other characters. And I saved this last stand-alone novel for three years. It was so worth it. He is as usual brilliantly smart, witty, and desperately in love with English language. Alas, there is nobody out there with such a turn of phrase, with an uncanny ability to make words dance and twirl like a dozen of dervishes. So, it is over. Farewell Reg, you are sorely missed. Angels with you."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"It's been a while since I've finished a book by Ian McEwan feeling more than satisfied, probably not since On Chesil Beach. From 1997-2001  it  seemed he couldn't miss. Then came a few rocky bumps including Solar, which was plain awful and stopped me from reading his books.

The first 20 or so pages of The Children Act promised to be a return to his heights. I was hoping. He has a knack of writing a gripping opening (notably Enduring Love) and then letting it slip a little... there was so much promise in the opening and then it basically deflated towards the end. He does seem to be predisposed to write about the upper middle class and their emotional problems as they drink fine wines and listen to classical music... alongside the freak-show of the lower classes and their predisposition towards stupidity, violence and slyness.

I wonder why I bother while there is a young man, David Mitchell, who is out there with thunder and lightening. McEwan's writing seems a bit dusty and uninteresting in comparison.

Still, I give it three stars, as he does have his moments."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"My Cowboy Valentine - Jane Porter & Tanya Michaels

Be Mine, Cowboy by Jane Porter
Cade is a recovering alcoholic who is back in Rachel's life after walking out on her five years ago when she attempted to help him with his problems. In the five years since her heart was broken, Rachel has been struggling to raise her autistic son, doing everything she can to protect him from people who don't understand him. Now that Cade is back she is struggling with feelings that never went away and has to decide whether or not she can trust him not only with her but also with her son.

Be Mine, Cowboy is a sweet, emotional read. Rachel's love for her son is evident in everything she does and you really feel for her and the issues that can come with raising a special needs child. Cade knows that he hurt Rachel when he left and is doing what he can to make amends and win Rachel back. I really enjoyed their story and Jane did a great job. My only wish is that it was a longer story.

Hill Country Cupid by Tanya Michaels
Tess is known for doing what she can in helping out her friends in giving them a push towards something that they want. She's known Nick for several years and decides that he needs help in courting the woman he's lusted after since high school. While helping Nick become more comfortable in flirting with the opposite sex, Tess realizes that she has feelings for Nick but doesn't want to be anyone's second best.

Hill Country Cupid is a nice, fun Valentine's read. I loved Nick and Tess together and seeing them overcome the obstacles keeping them apart. I really enjoyed Nick's determination to show Tess that she is his first choice above anyone else and that they belonged together."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I read this book before assighning it to my children.  It was definitely a fun read, and leaves you hanging so that you HAVE to read the sequel.

Yes, it does not set up blacks in a very good light, but one must consider the time it was written.  In any regard, many of the whites were portrayed in unseemly manners as well (cutthroat, evil, stupid, cowards, etc.).  As an adult, I would believe that people are smart enough to weed out the literary license taken by this piece of fiction; and discuss the book with their children as to it's story, characters, and intent.

I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I loved the book, hated the hype. I know it can't be helped but I'm always afraid of people who thrust Bridges of Madison County at me and told me, with tears in their eyes, that it would CHANGE MY LIFE...okay, it did not. End of that subject.
But it seemed like LB would appeal to those same readers.
So I quickly bought LB as soon as I saw the hype begin. It was a wondeful first novel by a talented writer. Her heaven sounds good enough to me that I might have to reconsider my whole ""heaven"" thing. Besides, she put dogs in her heaven so the book got an automatic 3 stars just for that.
Susie, the murdered girl narrator is believable and without a shred of self pity or angst. Her story unfolds much like you would expect it to as she describes the aftermath of disaster. I loved the grandma, was puzzled by the mother and thought she captured the sister, brother and murderer very well. I was glad she didn't go into any kind of poor murderer he had a terrible life, thing. Ya gotta figure he did. And I'm glad she stuck it to him in the end...
She really captured my interest with her portrayal of the father and I was touched by his travels through grief, despair, revenge and losses...
Enjoy the book. It's well under the hype radar but well worth it as a good read."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"It's tough to imagine someone writing a hilarious recounting of her struggles with OCD, scrupulousity and anorexia, but crafty girl Jennifer Traig has done just that.  The humor here is burst-out-loud funny.  Ms. Traig has a true ear and eye for finding the humor in any story.  And - that's the thing...some of these stories are - humor stripped away - pretty darn bleak.  When Jen's parents yank her out of school before the end of her junior year, you know things are pretty out of control.  The author - thankfully able to look back with perspective, sanity and health intact - is cognizant enough to concede the point.

Ms. Traig gives a lot of credit and support to her family for putting up with her over the years.  My favorite passage in that regard is this one:

""...but as I grew older, crazier and more religious, I felt as though I didn't blend in anywhere.  I was just so weird.  I didn't even fit in my own family.  This was largely my doing.  I'm the one who caused it...My parents had done everything right, ruling the house by dictatorship, a method that works so well for much of the Third World.  It didn't work for me.  Every day, I was stirring up insurgencies, issuing fatwas. declaring holy war on the whole...family.""

Now, that's a chick who can seriously write.  Excellent stuff, Jen.

One quibble about the industry reviews at the top of this page...where Publisher's Weekly says ""In this 1970s memoir, Traig describes how, from the age of 12 until her freshman year at Brandeis..."".  This is incorrect.  The author makes clear in the book that she went (at least Freshman year) to UC Berkeley.  Her PhD is from Brandeis."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This isn't a just a zombie SAW-like story, but how a world through different culture lens and infrastructure/climate respond to a viral epidemic. With the world becoming more connected because of technology and ease of transportation, the ease of transportation can facilitate the spread of disease on a global unprecedented level. But little has been considered how to use our growing technology to solve global disease outbreaks in a macro sense. How to pay attention to what happens in Hong Kong and make changes at SFO right away to respond to it. It makes sense that currently government officials dub viral/outbreak police training scenarios with 'Zombie' references. I can't read it at night, I did three times and each time I had a Zombie nightmare. City planners, Architects, Engineers, Designers, and other problem solvers will have fun reading this book. It's a narrative chess game that you kind of start at the solution and you just enjoy the path to it. Top five reads for this year."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""Fallen Dragon"" is an awesome sci-fi novel by an incredible talent in the genre.  Some of these reviews compare the novel unfavorably to Hamilton's ""Night's Dawn"" trilogy, but I think it's rather better:  while ND is an epic space opera which draws strength from both its exploration of posthuman themes and grand drama on a cosmic scale, Fallen Dragon's strength is in its focus on characters and a far more mature style than was evident in ND.  Fallen Dragon basically focuses on three characters and their involvement in the travails surrounding a particular colony world (though these events have implications for all human society, one eventually discovers), and this focus helps to create a strong storyline and character development that really matters to the reader."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it. And really, I am not overly into politics, but I know that by supporting this travesty of a man and his pushy attitude the United States of America is sending the world the wrong kind of message."

Kate has been sort of a wonder woman through the whole series, so the ending of this book just didn't seem consistent.  I know Mutt was a gift from the aunties when Kate returned to the Park but it would have been interesting if Stabenow had provided a sort of history of how the aunties came to be in possession of a wolf/husky puppy."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"So, it's over the top, outrageous, ridiculous even.  But, it's so dang funny -- And, you'll actually root for the serial killer, who's not all that bad.

You absolutely must have a sense of humor to read Dorsey.  It's not cartoon-y, more of a futuristic Keystone cops on bad dope, perhaps?

Anyway, the Florida historical information is rich and believable and Dorsey includes enough truth in his work to make you think maybe the Sunshine state residents are sniffing the Coppertone a bit too enthusiastically.

If you need an escape and can't afford a plane ticket or the time to get away, try this book (or any of the other Dorsey novels) and you'll emerge refreshed and perhaps a bit stunned, but you'll know you've been somewhere."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I enjoyed the story, but her books always touch my heart and this one fell a little short. And every time the TV show was mentioned Gut It! was used--very distracting. Also, the name of the show was jarring. I picture ""gutting"" a deer, not a home. HGTV has shows like Generation Renovation, Fixer Upper, Rehab Addict. Ms. Delinsky should have taken her cue from those names. But she still remains one of my favorite authors in this genre."

Books_5,5.0,OR,A book that raises your awareness to social and cultural issues in other parts of the world.  Powerful and extremely well written.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statements of facts introduced into this book are true.  Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.

Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.

Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.

As I was thawing out mentally from the vast empty ice floes of northern Greenland where the novel played out its last pages, I began to see a few areas in the plot where Hoeg was skating on pretty thin ice.  But while I was reading, they didn't show, and even after, they didn't matter much.  Smillas cold universe was amazingly real, whether it was true or not."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Set in 14th century England, Lord of Fairley, Jonathan is being forced to marry. The king has given him two weeks to find a bride, or one will be found for him. In an attempt to help him, his mother enlists the aid of Lady Alice, the daughter of one of her friends, while making it clear to Jonathan that Alice is not a suitable bride for him. Together, Alice and Jonathan make a list of all the eligible ladies at court and begin to plan ways for Jonathan to meet the ladies and determine their suitability.

The meddling by Margaret led to numerous humorous situations, awkward meetings, and two main characters both wondering why the other wasn't a suitable match. Both the plot and characters were relatively straightforward. There were no major plot twists to jump out at readers. The characters behaved true to character, again with few surprises. They were easy to like, if a bit blind to the manipulation going on around them.

This was a cute story. As far as historical romance goes, it was pretty light on historical details beyond the setting and a few period specific situations. As long as readers can picture a royal court, period dress, and a lack of modernity, there is no real need for background knowledge or even interest in historical events.

As it has been a while since my last historical read, this was a fun change of pace. I found myself grinning at Margarets antics and the reactions of both Alice and Jonathan to the maneuvering going on around them. It was an entertaining, quick read, full of humor and fun.

Thanks to Lynsay Sands and HarperCollins for providing me with a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed this book.  The author has a strong voice, but the book was much less overtly personalized than the editorial reviews led me to expect, for which I was grateful. In all other respects, I thought the editorial reviews are pretty good summaries of what you will find in this book.

It could have been better edited.  Despite its chronological organization, there are a surprising number of places where a person or event who has died earlier in the book pops up again. For instance, after the chapter on  Mussolini is over, with Mussolini quite dead, one moves to a chapter that begins with the Allied invasion in WWII with Mussolini quite alive again.  Just some light editing would have smoothed this out very easily.  The index is, in the same vein, sparse and poor and omits references too often.

Last, the text emphasizes the visual aspect of Rome, as one would expect from an art critic.  But there are only two sets of photos, perhaps 30 or so altogether, a mere fraction of the images and sights described by the author.  I often wanted to be able to compare his descriptions to photographs of what he is describing but it is only rarely possible within the covers of the book. I don't know if the ebook is different but the experience of reading would really be enhanced if there were more photos located closely to what is being described or at least hyperlinks to an image on the web with what is being described.

I would give the text, standing alone, 5 stars but the overall work, for the reasons just stated, I grade at 4 stars."

For example, why was Truscott always following Alex and how did he get all of hs inside information? How could Truscott and Michael Bell know that Alex went to Vermont? How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen. Why wouldn't Alex have heard the shot when Michael Bell killed Truscott. So, basically I liked the book a lot but the ending was a big let down."

All skills are tested in this book. We start to get more information about who Kate really is, and what makes her so powerful. The chemistry between Curran and Kate is getting unbearable, for them and me! But she's not some dimwitted woman who falls for just anyone because he's cute (a.k.a. Rachel Morgan).

Books_5,4.0,OR,"TRUNK MUSIC is the fifth Harry Bosch detective novel and may be the best of the series so far. Mr. Connelly writes sharp dialogue and page-turning narrative. Beyond writing mechanics, the creation of hard-boiled detective Bosch is what makes the series so interesting. Because Harry Bosch is so interesting. Set in LA and Las Vegas, TRUNK MUSIC gets the reader involved in Hollywood slease, police corruption and mob antics on the way to solving the murder of a man left in the trunk of his car (hence ""trunk music""). I am getting a bit tired with Harry Bosch getting in trouble with his police bosses and IAD (Internal Affairs Division) and his fellow detectives suspecting him of being a rogue cop. I mean, Harry has solved many murders brilliantly and, by now, they should be trusting him more. So it seems a little unrealistic that they still come down hard on him for doing his job. Perhaps Mr. Connelly will see the logical flaw in the plot there and correct that with different plot complications and tensions in future Harry Bosch books. I don't know but maybe I'll find out in the sixth Harry Bosch story, ANGELS FLIGHT. Such nit-picking aside, TRUNK MUSIC is music to my ears."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I wish there was a 3 1/2 star option.  I am somewhere between this book is ok and liking it.  Andre and Devon are wonderful characters with great chemistry when they are in the throws of passion.  But, on the other side of that Devon starts out strong and fearless then turns to ""Andre"" mush and then fearless again.  It isn't very consistant.  Then there is Andre, who is a super hot French captian, but is just a brute!!!  There are times he is a head strong man ready to dive in and save the day, and other times he is simply a donkey's butt!

The plot is a strong one, untill we get to the island, then it is rushed alittle.  That is when the story becomes ok for me.  The ending ties up all loose ends, but not very engaging.

The other charachters in this book (Minter, for one) are really great.  I was hoping the second book was about him.

So, basically there were somethings I didn't like about the book, but the bulk of the book was good.  There is some love scenes, so beware if you are looking for clean romance.  (They are tasteful as far as passion goes)

It was a free read from Kindle, and even if I had purchased it, I wouldn't have been disapointed."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"And it's not easy to speak of these matters in contemporary America, but Baldwin's line about being pulled into the American family law system is akin to being tied to a truck and then dragged down a gravel road late is excellent. As he put it, no one can hear your cries, and it is not over until they say it is. I'm sorry that Mr. Baldwin had to go through what he did but hope that this memoir/analytical work sways minds and adds to the preponderance of the evidence concerning the lack of justice men now find in our courts of law. Protecting women is fine but the juridical operationalization of this notion has resulted in the persecution of the opposite sex. People need to be aware about what's going on so I'm appreciative that Baldwin is using his fame for the worthy and noble purpose of generating awareness. The great thing about this book is that the author does more than tell his own story. He includes the narratives of several men who experienced the same horrors he did. In conclusion, I'm very grateful Mr. Baldwin has graced us with this publication."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"No historian covers financial subjects as well as Ron Chernow. This book on Hamilton, as well as his previous efforts on John Rockefeller (Titan) and JP Morgan (The House of Morgan) are thoroughly researched, clearly written and offer entertaining reading, despite covering complicated topics.

  One reviewer suggested that Chernow was more comfortable in the 19th century than the 18th and I suppose that is true.

  But this book, in my view, is superior to Titan. In Titan, I felt Chernow was to some extent a slave to chronology. He seemed determined to devote about a chapter to every period of Rockefeller's life. When Rockefeller retired in his 40s, Titan lost a lot of its focus. Rockefeller lived to be 90, and I felt a lot of the second half of that book was padding.

  With Hamilton as a subject, there was no way for the author to fall into that trap again. Hamilton's origin and youth in St. Croix are still shrouded in mystery, and, not to spoil the ending, but I assume most readers are aware of Hamilton's rather sudden demise at the age of 49.

  That of course was too bad for Hamilton, but it makes for a more exciting book. We see Hamilton as a grown man and soldier in the American Revolution by chapter three and then leading an eventful live that makes for a lively biography, when the author is up to the task.

  As Chernow most certainly is.

  This book took me somewhat by surprise. I don't know what is next for Mr. Chernow, but I actually was expecting, after Rockefeller and Morgan that he would do a biography of Carneige.

  Then his publishers could package the set as ""The Tycoon Triology"""
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Meena Harper is a typical woman living in NYC - she picks the wrong men, says the wrong things (aka predicts people's deaths), and attracts vampires. Okay, so maybe she isn't a typical NYC woman, but what she is is a fun character. In this sequel to Insatiable, readers are welcomed back into her life six months after the first novel ends.

As the novel opens, readers see Meena as a serious agent for the Palatine. Her brother Jon is still trying to get a job with the Palatine. Alaric still wants Meena. Lucien still wants to make Meena his bride.

And that's just the start of it. There is a rising vampire army hunting Meena; there is the Palatine hunting Lucien; and there is something ""off"" about the new members of the Palatine.

With a fast-paced plot and quite a few twists and turns throughout, Cabot has written an intriguing sequel. If you enjoyed Insatiable, you will not be disappointed with Overbite.

On a final note, I just want to say how much I really enjoy Cabot's taking on vampirism. She is clever, funny, and satirical, making these some of my favorite Cabot novels. This is the reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 4."

O'Brien is unable to find a structure of any kind, and the book suffers greatly for the lack of it.  She is charming, as are her descriptive passages about places, but she leaves out the human detail.  Many famous people are mentioned, but the reader is told little of importance about them, so there is a high level of frustration. But if you like her stuff you're going to read it anyway..."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Is this a great novel, or just a great read? That's the question I ask myself before writing this review.  Right now, I can't answer the question.  For me, only time and another read or two will lean me towards one or the other.  I am content now in saying it was a great read,  I really did enjoy it.  Like many, I read through quickly.  The imagery was clear, striking and gripping.  While there was little complex plot to speak of - it didn't need one.  In a world such as that, life becomes simple and difficult, that's how the story was presented.

I question some of the decisions by the father, but he's not meant to be infallible, just human.  His identity and former life are meaningless in such a world, and he is left anonymous, which I truly appreciate.  I can also appreciate the risk the boy took at the end - how difficult would it be to carry on alone?

I can't yet give the book five stars, and wavered between three and four, but it's entirely possible that as the years go by and I pick this one up again, I may appreciate it more.  Given the time it takes to read, it's worthwhile for just about anyone."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I am enjoying this book very much.  Hate to put it down.  The plot is excellent.  Hope there will be more books after this one.

Ailig MacLeod has be order by King Robert the Bruce to return to his clan and depose his father Neill MacLeod as Chiefton.

On Ailig's return he runs into one of his fathers Champion warrior harassing a the young widow Morainn. Her husband Hamish has been dead for 2yrs and her days of morning are over. Morainn character is ok. She is determine never to marry again and of course she fall in love with Ailig. Ailig does a good job of getting his Clan to except and trust him. In the beginning his father Neill hates the idea an does everything he can to not pass on the Cheifton to him. He seems to hate Ailig and it becomes clear why. The story held my interest. It just doesn't have much romance going on an very little sex nothing even worth mentioning. Bk. 1 and 2 just lacks that hot sexy romance story I like in the H/H. These books end abruptly for the couples. There is no epilog to let you know how the couple fared together. There are unanswered question. Such as Morainn believes she is barren. She tried to have children by her dead husband but didn't. This could have been the dead husbands fault!! But the situation is not explored.  I got the books on  Kindle Unlimited. I am not sure I would spend money buying them now that I have read the first two books in the series. To many unresolved issues in both books."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows thats what everyone else does.
 John Green, The Fault in Our Stars

I am emotionally drained from this book. What fantastic writing. It's hard to tell you about the story without giving so much away. It's a story of struggle, love. and loss. This book will definitely have you taking a step back and thinking about what you truly believe, what you feel your purpose on this earth is, if there is even a purpose? I absolutely loved this book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I don't remember the last time I read ""David Copperfield.""  I've heard it said that this book of Dickens' is somewhat autobiographical, but I don't know for sure.  One thing I've enjoyed since I bought my 3 Wordsworth Classics is the exposure to 18th century English culture through Dickens' wonderful prose.  ""David Copperfield"" will have to wait until ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Great Expectations"" had been read through first."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only ""Jane Eyre."" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.

This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic ""A Room of One's Own."" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.

This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after ""Jane Eyre"", ""Shirley,"" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic ""Madame Bovary"" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.

One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.

The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.

This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.

This is simply a great read."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a writer, and this book, this introduction to another culture, is beautifully written. There were times that I became so emotionally involved with this book that I had to put it down and do something else. It's a novel. But I believe it to be autobiographical, too. If you ever had any questions about India, this is for you."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This Oxford Classics edition has much to recommend it. First, it is translated into smooth modern English, which, while not conveying every subtlety of Greek, will nontheless help the present-day reader through this long work. Second, the price is under $10. Third, there is an excellent map collection at the back showing the ancient world as we see it and as Herodotus saw it. The notes, bibliography, appendices, indexes, timeline and glossary all make this a great resource for the student or casual reader. There is enough mention of content in all the other reviews. I just wanted to point out the advantages of this edition."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened. About as much validity is attached to the author's work as that of Von Daniken."

This is actually the opposite of what Descartes believed.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have been provided a treat for the next twenty-eight days: one chapter of Camille Paglia's GLITTERING IMAGES per day, no more, no less. Today I read Chapter 1, on Queen Nefertari. It all began last night with a first reading of Paglia's bracing ""Introduction"" to her most recent book. The ""Introduction"" is required reading for anyone teaching undergraduates, but also for pre-tertiary level teachers. In it, Paglia deftly and clearly diagnoses the current condition of American culture and education, and prescribes the pharmakon: art. As always in her books, Paglia personalizes her perspective, which since SEXUAL PERSONAE has been among the few sources of fresh air in our ""confused"" times. She reminds us by example that there are still teachers in academe. They (we) are very much alive, often in small schools and universities without big names. Thanks to Pantheon for making her book available in its glittering form. If we pay attention to Paglia, there may be some chance of salvaging the sinking ship of undergraduate education. I would recommend that readers buy an extra copy of GLITTERING IMAGES and give it to a college or university administrator. If we take Paglia's advice, students might again be afforded an education and not job training. Here is the real thing. While the group of us who came of age intellectually during the 60's are aging, Paglia's latest is a reminder that we are far from finished. The operative word in Paglia's book is ""floating"" (sometimes ""hovering"" echoes it). It reminds us of what art provides: concrete transcendence."

The elves fair and graceful, I would prefer this type to bring me presents during Christmas. Men some unwise and others wise. A perfect description of reality!

Books_5,4.0,OR,The book was good. It introduced many more characters and also had a very good plot and minor plots. You should read this book if you liked the first ones.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I really do think the world would be a better place if everyone read this book. It connects you to violence in a sometimes disturbing way, but the overall message is one of empowerment. I admit to being more afraid than I was before I read this book, until I got to the last chapter on dismissing the kinds of fear that you don't need: worry, paranoia, and anxiety. Now I feel safe in the knowledge that I will prevent the violence I can, and live without worry of what I can't prevent. I know my life will be better for having read this book."

The early part of the 20th century is seen through the eyes of a Russian nobleman who has become a ""non-person"" under the communist regime and he consigned to a tiny space in the attic of the grand Metropole Hotel in Russia, under house arrest.  How he overcomes his circumstances is the substance of the story."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"I must confess I did not make it all the way through this book. It seemed like too much of a Holly Black ""Modern Faerie Tale"" fan fiction story and not very original at all. Also I was not attached to any of the characters enough to press on. If you read ""Tithe"", ""Valiant"" or ""Ironside"" by Holly Black before reading this book and/or this series you will know what I'm talking about. This is simply published fan fiction. Sadly it's not written badly, I just wish it was more original."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"One of the problems associated with being a popular genre author, is that after awhile, the books just a seem to blend together. I've read everything Grisham has written, and really the only one that sticks out was the Pelican Brief, and The Firm. Gray Mountain has the same mix of ingredients as previous novels. Lawyer with some sort of issue. Injured party needing a lawyer. Some big nasty law firm. Some big nasty corporation. Mix together. Publish.  Not saying Gray Mountain is bad. It is a decent read, but it just seems to be so predictable that you never really loose yourself in the novel."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I liked it . However, I did not understand why the author had the lead character looking down on his mentor for not acting on his suspicions when the main character looked the otherway himself despite the evidence until someone died. Yet he lectured his mentor but does not mention his less than honorable actions and what it took for him to act on his suspisions. Anyway, I do recomend giving it a read."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I liked Conspiracy of Paper very much, but Liss is even more successful with The Coffee Trader.
The plot is extremely intricate, and the reader must work to stay with it, but the work pays off in a terrific resolution.
Though I admire Liss's attention to detail and historical veracity, what I most appreciate is that his characters are convincingly three-dimensional.  Few people are all good or all bad, yet the proliferation in modern fiction of characters who are no more than straw men is appalling.  Liss gives a reader characters that are convincing in their strengths, flaws, and manifold complexities.
All in all, this is one of the better suspense stories of recent years, and I recommend it without qualification."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book is a masterpiece.  It deals with the making of a geisha and how she is practically a prisoner to her sponsors,even after she becomes a full fledged geisha.  It is so emotionally written with such perfect narration that you literally do not want the book to end. At a very young age our heroine is sold to a geisha house to prevent her from starvation and death.  It is a fate that is chosen for her and she must oblige, it is better than dying or is it?  Written with such beautiful words and creating a mood that you swear you are in Japan.  You cry and laugh for her but you will not be disappointed as she triumphs sheepishly and then with courage through her chosen destiny.  Can she find a true beautiful  love in spite of everything?"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I have to say, I got this book out of chance and have to put out there that I feel bad I hadn't known about this title before.

This story is basically a modern day Romeo and Juliet but that hype of Shakespeares' master work never wore the story down for me. Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person her and her family have known to despise, however, as the reader starts to grasp the power of love in this novel...it gives judgment a whole new meaning.

Mary E. Pearson knows what she's doing. I love the surprise, twist'n turns and the balance of drama, romance, and mystery in this novel. I'd recommend this to any young adult who are looking for that classic love story that we all love with a guarantee of a soft, exciting, original teen love romance. This book will have you appreciate and be more hopeful for that special person that you may or may not have come across in life.

Scribbler of Dreams is what every young adult needs."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have been on Eugene Peterson kick recently. The more books that I read from him, the more I am drawn to his writing. He is wise, earthy, and poetic, a wonderful combination. Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination (1988) was the most recent.

In Reversed Thunder, Peterson explores the creative and imaginative language of St. John in the last book of the Bible. In my experience, many books about the Revelation of John attempt to provide a key to the events of the book as a type of apocalyptic road map. In other words, many books claim to have found the key to the end times and are eager to share their findings. This book is refreshingly different.

In the introduction, Peterson wrote, ""I do not read the Revelation to get additional information about the life of faith in Christ. I have read it all before in law and prophet, in gospel and epistle. Everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the previous 65 books of the Bible...I read the Revelation not to get more information, but to revive imagination."" Later: "" I have taken the position that this book does not primarily call for decipherment, as if it were written in code, but that it evokes wonder, releasing metaphors that resonate meanings and refract insights in the praying imagination.""

To be honest, this is the first thing I have read about the book of Revelation that I have actually benefited from, actually enjoyed. Peterson, a poet in his own write, writing about the poetry of St John is a lovely gift. If you are someone who has been confused by the book of Revelation, I would commend Reversed Thunder to you.  It is well worth the time."

Against a backdrop of their open border policy (Hart-Celler), the legacy of Kennedy's, the Jesuits inciting Latinos with ""liberation theology""  (anti-anglo-protestantism) to ensure newcomers will be filled with that peculiar hate as the border is opened for them---- such same old!  And instead of a warning to them, and in the world where the Catholic murder of Christians in Serbia so recently (oh, is that just a big silly thing that should be put in ""histoical context"" also?) is known to so many--- one wonders.  Do such people ever begin to take in anything at all of ""the other?""  Even as they moralize?  Even as they harm?  Even as they do not look at their own real history, but only seek to cover it?"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"The Boy on the Bridge is M.R. Carey's long-awaited sequel to The Girl With All the Gifts. As in the first book a plague has swept through the world making humans that contract the fungus ""hungries""--essentially zombies whose only purpose is to devour the flesh of living creatures. Rosie, a heavily fortified vehicle, filled with soldiers and scientists sets out from Beacon (the last fortified encampment in the UK) to find a cure.

A third type of intelligent life, ""the children"", discovers them in a village where the scientists have been taking samples of hungries. A soldier attacks and kills one of the children and they return hostilities. The dead child is taken for research, but the rest of the clan follows the retreating Rosie everywhere.

The story is filled with action, intrigue, and fascinating characters making for a page turning story. I highly recommend this science fiction book."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others."

  I would like to thank the author for making me feel less alone on my journey.
I will re-read the book each year I'm sure and buy copies for the all the women in my life."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"gets you from the start, If you've read gone girl and liked that you will love this as well. it's got great characters and the plot is super thick. Libby is a great main character with a creep feel. the whole book is great -- read it!"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This was another one of Stuart Woods' Stone Barrington novels that once I reached the half way point I could not put down.  It was easy to picture the action in my mind as I read each chapter, particularly the last half of the book.  It really came alive."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"So, I've never read any of Dimon's work, but the blurb had me SUPER interested to see what would happen. I have to say I was NOT let down in the slightest. Although this book was slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapters to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eyes bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"My theory is fiction writers (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists.  Every psychiatrist I know has gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis.  Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies.  If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude.

Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption.  We are introduced to each character in terms of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional.  (What is Schickler's own personal flaw?  Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss).  Each of these flaws is at the core of Schickler's stories.  The stories focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex.  We eavesdrop on each characters fantasies and insecurities.  (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy).  One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women.  Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious.  The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practices that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's dates had better be suspicious of nice diners).

In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with names changed to protect the innocent.  It's a book about losers scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling women allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.  That man's name is David Schickler."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The rare book that lives up to its rave reviews. I am always looking for books that tell the story of ordinary people living their lives. People that one can believe in. People with their flaws, but also capable of passion and compassion. The reader believes in these people and wishes them well. Ordinary lives become extraordinary.

The book is paired with Home, which is as good in a different way."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"When Roger Depue was growing up on the east side of Detroit in the late thirties, it was full of Southerners seeking assembly line work at the automobile factories.  His father was a sharpshotter police officer and the places they lived sound a lot like those I lived in as a child.  He had four brothers, all sharing the same bedroom.

In the sixth grade, he played Jesus in the Easter Passion play at his Catholic school and was on the cross.  This left a deep impact on him, as he always felt Jesus' sacrifice was bravery in action for the greater good.

He reached far beyond his father's law career by becoming chief of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit (a profiler to find serial killers) and spent forty years in law enforcement.  He worked as consultant on the Martha Moxley murder in Mass. and JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder.  His specialty was finding society's most depraved, brutal criminals.

After four decades of staring into the darkness of evil, when his wife of 32-years died, he entered a seminary for three years to search for the good and became a Brother of the Society of the Missionaries of the Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, Conn.

His son, Steven, became a deputy for the Fairfax County, Virginia, police.

Roger earned a BS degree in psychology, Masters in society and law, and PhD in counseling and development from American University.  He was a consultant on the movie, 'Silence of the Lambs, starring Anthony Hopkins.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"The story was able to hold my interest. However, I couldn't help viewing the main characters as self-absorbed, shallow children, even the grownups. I couldn't relate to their spoiled mannerisms and lazy lifestyle. But I kept reading because I felt that something, a shocking twist maybe, was going to occur eventually. Yet when it finally happened, it wasn't much. In fact, the twist was ridiculous and senseless. I gave the book three stars because it did at least hold my interest, which some novels are incapable of doing. Lockhart definitely has potential."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a tour de force. Davies stands the  Anglo-Franco-centric stance of most Western historians on its head. He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big  threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance  of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this  book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."

(Guess I'll order an extra copy to keep for myself.)  Each chapter deals with a 'miracle' that happens at the Van Gogh Cafe which is run by Marc and his daughter.  Very uplifting, life-affirming and magical.  I highly recommend this book for adults who want to remember the limitless joys of childhood."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

Books_5,5.0,OR,I loved it! I was riveted and was amazed at the information that was shared. Well worth reading.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"This was a waste of money. Boring, repetitive, gaps in plot...I was rolling my eyes most of the way through it. I bought it because I thought it would be just as good as Still Missing, but I was sorely disappointed."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This also was a Christmas present. My daughter-in-law spends many hours in the car,and enjoys listening to books on CD. I am really grateful  to Amazon for having such a wonderful selection of these items. Nora Roberts is one of her favorites, and so far I have been able to provide new ones for her. They arrive on time and are always a hit. Thank you for the service I will be ordering again next month, it is her birthday."
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I am a big fan of John Grisham, not only of his legal thrillers but also of his more literary undertakings. ""Playing for Pizza"" was just a huge disappointment for me. It felt like a potboiler Grisham dashed off to justify the expense of an Italian vacation or to make use of some scrap notes he'd made while working on a larger project.

The book's characters are quite 2-D. Ex-NFL quarterback Rick Dockery does undergo a small amount of personal growth in his acceptance of his situation in Italy but that's a pretty minor transformation against a backdrop of predictable stereotypical supporting cast members.

The plot is all but non-existent. It's really a slice of life rather than a true narrative. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Not only is the story line unfinished (that's not a crime, but in this case it's piled on top of the other issues the book presents and adds to the sense of incompletion), it's not clear it would have been interesting had Grisham bothered to bring it to a conclusion.

Overall, it's not only that I expect more of Grisham, it's that I expect more from any good book. This book just doesn't rank as one I'd recommend to anyone."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I like Michael Crichton. A lot. I began a long time ago with the Andromeda Strain and that was a super thriller.

Dragon Teeth is readable, but it is not a stand out and certainly way below the standard that made him one of the most popular author of thrillers.

There are several reasons for this:

1) Crichton is generally excellent in giving you a deep understanding of the issues involved and leaves you enlightened and informed. For example, in Rising Sun he describes exactly how and why the Japanese company's surveillance cameras were superior and why American sleuths could not retrieve relevant images. In Disclosure he describes how the HR department functions and what is involved in cases of allegations of sexual harassment.

Dragon Teeth is supposedly similar with paleontology as the backdrop. I disagree. The background provided is cursory and a fifteen minute read on the topic on Wikipedia will leave you better informed.

2) Crichton is excellent with cliffhangers. Each chapter leaves you waiting to see what happened next. The pace is relentless the climax is tremendous. Dragon Teeth is distinctly ho hum. The descriptions could come from a travel brochure, the characters are not well developed, and there is little to no suspense.

In addition, there are loose ends. I will not say more because this would be a spoiler but one significant character introduced with fanfare leads you to believe that this character plays an important role in the tale. Instead this character then simply vanishes.

3) There are discrepancies which are jarring. For example, he describes the protagonist as having a full, luxuriant mustache. A sentence later he says that he had a clearly visible scar on his upper lip. The two are incompatible. He can have one or the other but not both.

Overall, this is a reasonably good read but not a thriller and nowhere near the standard one would expect from Michael Crichton."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I am completely blown away by the beautiful detail of this book. If this kind of care and attention were still given to the publishing of all great literature we might find that more people would still have the respect for reading that we once did.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I just received this book 10 minutes ago so I am unable to comment on how thoroughly it covers the basics. It appears to have a lot of detail on how to use the program.

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. If you have a previous version of Quickbooks and want to know any gotcha's about what happens to your data while upgrading (or how to get your data migrated into the new version) this is not the guide. If you are concerned about advanced topics such as 64-bit systems or server-based versus desktop-based or how to lock it down so everyone in the company doesn't have to be a super-user just to use the software this type of information does not appear to be in this book. There is some coverage on managing users in chapter 26 but little on how to make multi-user work so more than one person can use the software at a time and what the issues/limitations are,

In summary - if you have already got your computer guy/gal to install and set it up for you, this looks to be the right book for you. If you have an unopened box or are trying to understand what the install instructions mean, it is not and you will need additional info."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"If you enjoy reading the world of Harmony this won't be an exception.  I've enjoyed these books and realized along the way I missed this one.  This is a short story, set pretty early in the series.  Virginia is a para-archeologist and Sam is a ghost hunter.  They have decided to merge their businesses and enter into a marriage of convenience (MC) but Virginia is getting cold feet.  She has feelings for Sam but he only seems interested in business and she isn't sure she made the right decision when she agreed to the marriage of convience.  Sam has actually has feelings for Virginia but he thought his best shot at a relationship was starting with a MC.  Their first business deal together as a partnership brings trouble and danger to the couple and now Virginia and Sam must work together to stay alive and survive in the tunnels of Dead City.  Sam has to convince Virginia to stay with him not just in business but forever and keep her safe.  This has all the trademark romance, humor and fun of the Harmony series and I really enjoyed it.  A quick, light read."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"McIntyre sets out from California to see if he can get all the way across the country without touching money, relying only on average Americans for shelter and food. It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

Funny at times and heartbreaking at others, this was a well written and fascinating story."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I haven't rated a book with 5 stars in a long time, but I loved the craftsmanship with which Alice Hoffman wrote this book. She didn't rush through her plot strands; she tied all the pieces of the plot together; she took time to make reflections on life.  I was most impressed and enjoyed reading this novel.  I enjoyed the way each of the Sparrow women made a contribution to their bloodline.  Some readers may feel that there is too much narration and not enough dialogue which occurred to me at first, but I found the author's writing skills balanced out my preference for dialogue.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!

I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.

The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.

If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I haven't read a historical romance in a very long time. after reading this book I remembered what I was missing. the chase, the heat when catching.  I really enjoyed reading this book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,An engaging tale that parallels outcomes we might see today. Hard to put down and easy to get into. If there is any criticism it is that details were too deeply researched resulting in a few sections that continued beyond the sale. But in the end that made it all the more believable.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"Hello Darkness has a convoluted story line that's forgettable about five minutes after you've finished reading it.  The story's main character, Paris, is the host of a late night radio show.  Besides playing music, she also gives her callers advice.  When a caller asks advice about her love life, Paris tells her to drop her loser boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Paris's normal callers.  This turns out to be bad advice, as the dumped boyfriend decides to abduct her.  This is the start of an incoherent story involving an old flame of Paris, whose son is involved with a sex club website that the abducted girl's father runs.  Yes, it's about as silly as I described.  The book is not well written, not remotely memorable.  I would recommend passing on this novel.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The Book of Illusions--being the story of the narrator's encounter with Hector Mann, a former silent filmmaker--presents quite a few passages where the narrator describes one of Mann's films.  As I was reading Auster's novel, I kept thinking I ought not to like the book so much.  After all, describing Mann's work seems patently second-hand--""telling"" in creative writing workshop language--and all the narrative commentary effectively takes interpretation out of readers' hands.  Yet, I could not put the book down.  The forthright prose and the resulting sincerity of the narrator won me over.  I didn't mind his being my eyes and ears.  Auster's movies seemed real.  While I didn't find myself watching the movies with him, he did make me want to watch them.  Narrators you care about can overcome any skepticism."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""The Winter's Tale"" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and it boasts one of the best ensembles of characters in the entire canon. This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.
The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes. While taking us on that journey Shakespeare glorifies the ideas of grace and forgiveness, the simplicity of country life, the lasting bonds of friendship, the power of parenting, the ardor of young love, the patience of mature love, and in the great character of Paulina, the lengths and benefits of loyalty. This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.
This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Read it, and then try to find a really superior theatre company doing a performance. Enter the kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia; meet Paulina, Autolycus, the Old Shepherd and his doltish son, as well as many others. You will be glad you did!
As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"You know what I loved about this book?  I never had to forgive the hero or the heroine for being an idiot.  Not once did they betray each other. Not once did they fail to forgive a shortcoming.  There was no subterfuge, no great misunderstanding.  It's just a story of a man, trying to win a woman's heart --and succeeding.

Margaret is firmly on the shelf at 30 when her brother inherits a Dukedom.  He decides to share his good fortune with his sister, offering a sizable dowry for her to finally snag a husband.  That money is just what Rhys needs.  But when he meets Margaret, he is taken with her quick wit and strong will... and he knows they would be a perfect fit.

Margaret wants a man to love her for more than the money her brother is offering.  And Rhys' financial problems are no secret, so it takes some time before she is assured of his affections.  But the sexual tension is good and when they finally come together, it's great.  There are a few foils for the couple along the way, but they're all external.  It's a short read... only a little over 100 pages... but a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  4 stars."

It explains how the whole project was possible and should answer any 'naysayers' with scientific explanations of the successes and the problems that had to be dealt with.
Books_5,3.0,OR,"At this time of year I read Christmas romances. Lots of them. (If I could find Kwanzaa, Hannukah, Yule, or other winter solstice holiday romances I'd read those, too. ) Because I love themes of family and redemption that are so often present in these books. It's a fairy tale, but it's a fairy tale I really enjoy. Christmas in Snowflake Canyon brings me all the things I want in a holiday romance. It's got a disabled hero who is recovering from his injuries and the war that caused them (and an excellent presentation of disability), a heroine who absolutely has to grow up and comes to realize that on her own, matchmaking, and lots and lots of family fun. I'll be looking for more by RaeAnne Thayne."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Blasphemy is the second book featuring Wynam Ford (now a private detective). In this book, Ford infiltrates a government-run facility which has built the world's largest particle accelerator for a mere $40 billion. (Please suspend your disbelief.)  I like the way Preston has worked together several subplots which all culminate at the end of the book for a complex climax. I am also a fan of Preston's easy writing style--it's good for a quick read. I am not a fan of Preston's portrayal of Born Again Christians--I think it's a bit over-the-top, though I guess it's a reasonable depiction of a very small percentage of rapture-ready Christians. Also, Preston is clearly not a physicist, but I guess not everyone can be perfect. :) Overall, I think Blasphemy was good for a quick sci-fi/techno read, but shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a beach-book."
Books_5,4.0,OR,I read this book because I was really interested in how this religion worked was craziness they were meant to believe. I was sad that at 15 she was force to marry still a child and what she had to adorn and what she had to leave behind when she finally wanted to get out
Books_5,3.0,OR,"This is a well written book and the author skillfully plays with the reader's emotions.  In fact, you may experience quite a range of emotion -- all except for joy.  This is nothing joyful in this story.  There are times of less pain but there is always pain.  Getting to know the heroine is worth reading the book for even though it is not an easy book to read.  The hero, in my opinion, is an arrogant know-it-all that I could not accept for the majority of the story.  I liked him marginally better by the end. That said, if you can get through the Leningrad seige section, you may enjoy the rest of the book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I thought this book was a real page turner. I couldn't put it down until the end. I actually read the French translation
First I haven't read many Swedish authors so it was very entertaining to have that perspective instead something centered in the US
Second, the title in French is more descriptive ""men who hate women"". Very strong; a male friend of mine asked ""is that possible?"" and after reading the book you see why they chose such a strong title. I felt that that the author really thought about the stereotypes that people have against women and he came across was very sensitive.
Third, well the book was just well researched and interesting."

By
Scott Turow

This is the first one of  Scott Turow's books I have read and as I understand there was a movie made from this book.

A beautiful lawyer from the prosecuting attorney's office is raped and murdered. Rusty Sabich is chief deputy prosecutor for Kindle County, and his boss Raymond Horgan is up for re-election.  Rusty is handling the investigation of the murder despite the conflict that only he is aware of with his friend, Dan Lipramzer investigating the crime. They first focus on convicted sex offenders that Carolyn helped to prosecute. Then Rusty learns that his boss Horgan had a brief relationship with Carolyn. Meanwhile Rusty's marriage is in a shambles as his wife Barbara knows about his affair. As evidence surfaces Rusty he is arrested for the killing.  But is Rusty guilty?  Or will someone else be found to have done the terrible crime.

Instead of being a predictable legal thriller, like some others I have read, this great murder mystery has plenty of twists and turns through its thick and plot.

The book was supplied to me free of charge and did not ask that I do a positive review."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"What a book...read it in two days...Beth Hoffman is a fantastic writer...one of the best...there are no words to describe how I feel about this book...I thoroughly enjoyed it and the fact that it was set in the south, even made it better...highly, highly recommend reading her books...you can not go wrong. You are feeling what the characters are feeling, smelling the smells of the farm and hearing the bacon cooking...Enjoy everyone, you will not be disappointed"
Books_5,1.0,OR,Obviously a case of Leigh doing most (if not all of the writing) and riding on the coatails of her husbands name recognition.  I am sure this would not have been published without Davids name.  It is not very sophisticated writing and Polgara is awful immature for someone hundreds of years old.  She acts like a spoiled 16 year old.
Books_5,5.0,OR,I have bought 4 of these books because kids of all ages
Books_5,5.0,OR,This is a breathtaking story with chilling ethical and moral challenges that haunted me beyond the reading of the book.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nelson DeMille is my father's favorite author, and he suggested I begin with this book. My dad and I have pretty different tastes in books, so I wasn't sure I'd like this novel. I was pleasantly surprised. This novel had me from the beginning. I wasn't sure if I liked Paul Brenner, but he sure intrigued me. The case was interesting. The end, while not completely surprising, was still good enough to make me feel like I had a read a good book when I was finished. In fact, I was sad enough leaving the character of Paul Brenner that I looked up to see if DeMille had written another book starring him. I'm currently reading the sequel to The General's Daughter, Up Country (a phenomenal story btw). The General's Daughter was an easy book to read, but also an easy book to fall into. I couldn't put it down and am really glad I read it."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Scott manages to keep the suspense going with now a multitude of characters to draw from. The results are mixed. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I got to the end,and thought, ""Well, not a whole lot actually happened."" Sure there's a big ending that leaves everything hanging, but getting there made much of the book feel like set up for what has to be a nearing conclusion to the series. However, the series as a whole, I think, is one of the best out there right now for kids and adults alike."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"As always, Grisham delivers very captivating story line. Rather than last me for a while as an ""occasional"" read, I blew through this one in just a few short days.  Character development is spot-on, and the depth of information about the challenges faced by Appalachian Miners is very revealing.  I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.  I was also disappointed as I expected some follow-up editorial information/direction regarding the plight of the miners. Was it fully fact-based, an entertaining, yet trumped-up piece of fiction, or something else entirely?"
Books_5,5.0,OR,Early excellent book of a strong women by a great author........She knows how to mix history with romance and adventure.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I loved the suspense, will look forward to the final installment"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great 'how to' book for basic Pro Tools operations. I have it perpetually checked out from my local library.

It is very similar to the Officil ProTools 101 Courseware; in fact, they cover much of the same topics. If you are torn between the two, and you are less technically inclined, then this book is probably your best option. The official ProTools book does some with a nice video and some Plug Ins, but those are mostly available on the DigiDesign website."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Stories were outstanding, especially for a contemporary of that era which I am. Book was in rough condition when received.
badly worn with torn cover but text readable. Probably toss it when finished. First time that a book description did not match the book's condition. Since book was very inexpensive no complaints just facts."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I enjoyed receiving this book in the mail. It came in good shape and will be a nice addition to my collection.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I was embarrassed when this book arrived and I realized that I had just purchased a dressed up romance novel. The premise sounded great, but it is only a front. Niffenegger is painfully self indulgent. This would be great as a guilty pleasure for someone who can stomach it, but the write-ups are misleading."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Generations, several years pass throughout this book.  Tragedies of the worst imaginable kind.  WWII sadness, hardships and death.  Great story that follows one common denominator - Pegasus!"
Books_5,2.0,OR,The plot is not believable. The writer tries to create sensation without developing the plot intelligently.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This inspirational book is a MUST read in my opinion. Awesome true story about God's healing miracles, great and powerful love."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Already read about 15 Clussler books and this one is just the beginning of so many of his books.  Once you start this book, you just read till the end."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I red Alice long ago and now with so many years of living and of experience it hasn't lost the magic
Books_5,4.0,OR,Great book but unsatisfactory ending she have added a awful or brought back Alicia and her brother some parts felt like the book was winding down
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Smart, funny, awesome - you know, all the good stuff you want in a story.  Loved the relationships between the characters and the sense of humor present even while trekking a truly touching story. Good stuff."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have read the complete collection of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books so Raising Steam is like visiting old friends. Just like the others, you can turn to nearly any page in the book and it makes you chuckle. It's my kind of humor I guess."
Books_5,5.0,OR,A great family saga spanning the 20th century in Southern Italy. A great summer read.reminds me of James Mitchner weaving history with the lives of families.
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I struggle with a rating for this book, as it is beautiful, thought provoking, and elegant. But between the multiple narrators and the stream of consciousness style, it is a tough read. I recommend those who are advanced readers, and who can handle the complicated narration. But if you aren't an English teacher or a bibliophile, this book will probably make you crazy. It was even tough for me to get through the first third of the book. If you stick with it, and get use to the flow of her writing, you won't regret it."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I loved it and I hope the movie does the book justice.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Love every bit of this book had to offer. I am an avid subscriber of her Living magazine and follower of her blog but I still find this book extremely entertaining. It inspires anyone to grasp the concept of ""entertaining"" through the beautiful coffeetable type photos and well described pages. It does not even attempt to dictate the reader that the only place possible to lavishly celebrate life is to live in Maine. It teaches us to embrace the beauty of what you have, where you live and add a bit more passion to it. I would definitely consider this as a perfect gift to guests during the holidays."
Books_5,4.0,OR,my girls still love but I would say its not as good as the rest of the Pinkalicous family books.
Books_5,5.0,OR,This is such a great book!!!I hope there are many more books to comr! :) one of the best books in the series!
Books_5,5.0,OR,A brutally honest depiction of the holocaust. Beautifully written and emotionally riveting. I purchased the book after visiting the holocaust museum in Washington DC. A survivor who spoke to my students told them this was the most accurate depiction of the holocaust.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"The title sure had me fooled, but fully understand the reason once I read the book.  Craig Johnson hits another five-star winner on my growing list of everything he's written."
Books_5,5.0,OR,Nora Roberts hasn't lost her touch.  She can build the suspense until you feel it in your bones.  Good storyline with characters that are believable and brings you into the family.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I read the sexiest man alive and thought, nice....a new author.  I bought this based on my good experience and all the good reviews but I have to say Ms James couldn't decide what story she was telling.  Was it John and Rylynn...?  Kyle and Rylynn...Dex? Rae?  Jordon...the father?  Cameron?  There were so many sub plots going on and nothing was satisfying.  Very disappointing.  I'll have a hard time trying another one."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book, if possible, is even better than the first book, The Passage.  I love the twists and turns and I can't put it down.  Can't wait to see what happens in the last book of this trilogy."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I am a young teen who recently read this book and I personal believe that  this book is pretty innocent compared to the ""The Big Nate"" series. It Has intelligent humor unlike the big Nate series too. there is not a lot of disrespectfulness of other people in this book and it dosen't have bad messages unlike big Nate. The reason I am comparing it to big Nate series is because I am aware that both books are very popular and funny, but I have read big Nate, and i would agree that it has a very bad message, with unintelligent humor, and many inappropriate scenes. I would prefer children reading diary of a wimpy kid more so then the school drop-out who likes to skip school big Nate. In diary of a wimpy kid the main character is not a school drop-out But does talk a little bit about girls, but not a lot. Diary of a wimpy kid deals with some problems that people may face in real life in the dramatic middle school, like problems with friends, bullying, and looking ""cool"",  but the author took these problems and added some funny spice to them to make it a Funny novel that children can laugh at and say, ""I know exactly how he feels, but how did he deal with it? I think i am going to read on to find out."" this book is a great and funny series that is overall innocent and deserves only the best. It makes children want to read the addicting book. It takes problems people face everyday and turns them into a laughable story. I would suggest this book to all ages."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I love this book. It is so far my favorite series. But Cedric dies at the end. I am going to read the next ones inn the series.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Not really what I expected - far more into the sci-fi/fantasy realm than I was anticipating, having never read Neil Gaiman before. I did really enjoy the book. Nice vivid descriptions, imaginative story. I was really wondering how the boy was ever going to escape from the evil nanny!"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I do not have much time to write this review, but this book is one of the best on current world classics.  The other one I equally recommend is No One's World by Charles Kupchan"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is truly a lovely book that approaches the idea of death as a natural part of the cycle of life. My mother read it with me when I experienced the loss of several family members as a child. Coming from a family with very diverse religious beliefs, this was a great way of bringing about a discussion of death without imposing someone else's religious beliefs."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book was recommended by a friend and I use it in teaching my nursing students and as a reference.  It is the best reference I have found on EKG Interpretation, making it simpler to understand than other books"
Books_5,5.0,OR,Great read. Kept move at a very good pace. It was very easy to visualize the canyon walls as they climbed. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to go and visit Texas's high desert. Keep writing books of the caliber and I will keep reading them.
Books_5,5.0,OR,One of the very best I have ever read on the Mass. Everyone in my family has a copy!
Books_5,5.0,OR,"""The Go-Giver"" was a delightful story with a beautiful message; ""Go-Givers Sell More"" makes that message real and tangible.  This is not just another ""how to close the deal"" sales book, but rather a treatise on the real meaning of success, and the best (or only) way to achieve meaningful success.  Buy the book and put its lessons to work and I can safely predict that you will look back and say that it was one of the best investments you've ever made - not only in your career but in yourself."
Books_5,4.0,OR,Very entertaining but it seemed like he was trying to get a movie deal or something.  Not as intellectual or intertwined as other books of his.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This trail drive lead by Gavin McCord with help from his brawling cowboy friends take 3,500 longhorns to Missouri but the only buyer who has the money wants Gavin and his friends to push them West by Southwest to Santa Fe.  Now they will be on a treacherous drive to earn their money after a 1000 mile drive. I rated this as a great cattle drive story."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Add this book to the growing pile of books to give a child waiting desperately for the next (and final) installment in the Harry Potter series. This may make the wait a little less unbearable, though nothing will be much solace once J.K. Rowling pens the last page in Book 7. There's only so much one can do about that, after all.

The Thief of Always is also a great choice for anyone smitten by Lemony Snicket, as it features a similarly dark story line with menacing adult characters. There's none of the wonderful banter between author and reader found in A Series of Unfortunate Events, nor really any of the wickedly twisted humor, but there should be just enough terror and danger to keep most fans of this genre riveted.

Harvey Swick is 10 years old and very bored with the long, cold days of February. One day a mysterious man appears, suddenly, in Harvey's room. The man asks Harvey if he'd like to go someplace where life is always fun. Being a self-centered yet somewhat strangely trusting 10 year old, Harvey agrees, and he's led away by the man.

The house where the mysterious man takes Harvey is in a land that's always sunny during the day. Halloween and Christmas, those two revered favorite holidays of children, come every evening. Harvey and another boy, Wendell, have all their wishes granted in this wondrous house, but one day Harvey starts to see that all isn't as it should be, and evil lurks beneath the facade of perfection...

A quick and satisfying read, this is as entertaining for adult fans of the genre as children."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I like this series.  It has a lot of twists and turns in it.  I found that it was hard to put down.  good read for anyone that likes this style of books.
Books_5,5.0,OR,Really fascinating book! I'm changing my eating habits and feeling better already!
Books_5,4.0,OR,"The story of Damali Richards is a bit cliche...the ""chosen"" guardian of humanity against the forces of evil...she's a girl who falls for the wrong guy...the guy is killed by vampires and becomes on of the walking dead...yadda yadda yadda.  So, what makes L. A. Banks' story so interesting?

The most interesting twist to the general vampire fiction rule is the approach to the vampires themselves.  As the most powerful ""demonic"" force in all of Hell, outside of Satan himself, the vampires are the undead elite...snobs, if you will.  Their views toward other preternatural creatures can be seen as a vague social commentary of our world today.

Another interesting twist to the story is in the character of Carlos Riveria.  What becomes of a man who willingly sells his soul to evil but dies with a prayer in his heart?  The battle of good versus evil in the war for souls just got personal.

While the dialogue is a bit heavy handed at times...too much street slang and ""hip hop"" style references to be considered entirely credible...overall, I would have to say that Minion is a great read and a wonderful new take on an old fiction theme."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I've loved this entire series, with the last one I read always my favorite!  A topical story dealing with domestic abuse and drugs, the author has created a storyline to keep you invested in the outcome. Our heroine is dealing with an ex-husband involved in drug ring is doing everything a mother would do to keep her son away from this life and safe."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"This book might be useful for someone just digging into the issues of residential heating and cooling.  It's presentation format doesn't presume the reader has much prior knowledge of the material, which dovetails nicely with the medium-level details of the material.  I consider it a pretty decent overview, but by the time I had read it, other materials I had covered made this book redundant."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a fascinating book and story that must be read all the way through book three in the series to be truly understood. Once I realized what it was truly about, it became much easier to wade through the diversions that are set up with too much going on about minute details and the thoughts of the characters.  More action would have pleased me but I guess I am just accustomed to the masters of those kinds of books.

One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it.

I enjoyed this last book in the series more than the first two."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I really couldn't, this book is excellent! I kept wanting Dove and Sarai to find out her parentage, since they wanted to know so much about Alanna, but no. Next book! When Alianne, or Aly, daughter of Alanna the Lioness leaves home, she misfigures a vital piece to her plan - pirates. Pirates capture her, shave her bald, and sell her as a slave. To prevent being sold as a 'bed-warmer' (someone for the master to sleep with), she dives into danger to become damaged. She is finally thrown into a deal free, and becomes part of a kind family - one that is in the misfavor of the king. She becomes chosen by a trickster god to protect the children of the family. The climax rises, especially when a crow turned human just learning about romance decides he wants Aly for his mate."
Books_5,5.0,OR,Continued primary characters always new adventures with references to previous story lines
Books_5,4.0,OR,Wanted to read before I saw the movie.  Great for discussion as a part of a book club.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"My favorite book in the last few years.  The author's  language skills carry us through a number of traumatic and sensitive events, often allowing us  to see into the very soul of the main, and very real, characters, which I find both unsettling and unbelievably touching.  I'm anxiously awaiting Mr. Henderson's next book."
Books_5,4.0,OR,I understand this is the beginning of a new series. I will read the next book but the start is not as good as the Odd Thomas series.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Having read a considerable amount of Hemingway, I feel Paula McLain wrote an excellent  fiction about his first wife and his beginnings as an author.  Using this research, Paula highlighted the elements of Hemingway's personality that made him who he was....as well as greatly enlightening Hadley as a person and giving a good portrayal of the time of the ""Lost Generation"".  To me, the mood of the book even mimicked some of his writing....Reading this makes you want to read more of his works especially those that have been newly discovered in Cuba..."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I have all the Honor series and this is the book I like least.  Author seems to have run out of fresh ideas.  In fact, there were parts of the book where I was sure I had read in previous books.  Story line started out good but sort of faded out as the book porgressed"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Professor Weaver, writing in the late 1940's, clearly analyzes the cultural trends of his day.  Furthermore, he translates the form of those trends into the logical consequences they would embody if left unchecked.  Read this book;you will find yourself pausing ever so often to ponder the current state of our culture, as it mirrors these words written over 50 years ago.  His writing and style are clear and profound.  I often would find myself trying to strectch my reading times because the ideas expressed were so compelling."
Books_5,5.0,OR,An excellent read. The best thing to happen is watching the movie after reading the book. It was like watching my imaginative characters in real life.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a simple book, yet a great message.  My three year old son loves it, and he has never read this character before.  He typically likes Pooh and fireman and space things, but this has great ""boy"" stuff in it like boats, tanks, etc."
Books_5,4.0,OR,Good read with some twists.  Not as good as Gone Girl but still a good book.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Easy to read,  This is a perfect book to read before reading the Mists of Avalon.
I am a great fan of Ms Bradley, and an glad that she left us such great legacy.  So far I have not read one of her books that I was bored with, or skipped ahead to read the ending.  She kept me caught up in the moment.  I did not want to miss a word"
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I just got this.  It's nice.  Lots of cool pics. The pics in overall review is pretty accurate.  Pages seem good. About same thickness as Magic Garden. As pics on both sides of pages.  I can't tell about make leak thru yet.
My only complaint is a good chunk (3/4) of pics go thru the middle seam. So that's gonna be a problem getting at. As far as I can tell pages are not perforated either. I like the book tho so I'll make it work. The pics seem pretty original. Big pics that take up the whole page.
I plan on attacking the book with markers. Most of the pics will require fine line markers. Some pics have big areas but almost every pic had areas of small details as seen in main summary. A couple of pages are empty of the small details- some are blank for you to detail your own. Ex butterflies etc. Least that's what is says up in corner of page.
It also apparently is kind of a search and find book too, tiny objects to find within the pics....with answers in the back. So its interactive. Good for all ages.
So for the price. I'm a very happy camper and can't wait to get my new markers in the mail and get going.

Side note. There are pages where the book left blanks for you to draw or fill then in. There are approx 14 of those out of about 43 actual coloring pages. The regular pgs still sold me the book. About 6 pgs of answers in the back."
Books_5,4.0,OR,I like this series so far.  On to the next book  in the Virgil Flowers series.  Hoping the momentum doesn't stop.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"No question about it how corruption and the inequality cast a shadow in the hearts of America. Noam Chomsky is brilliant in explaining in detail of the abuse by the Corporation and government manipulating and the consequences. How lucky we are also still to be alive with decisions that were made from the past to present. But what is, more importantly, is what was said to overcome these degradations by uniting the people together, in which Noam Chomsky speak off by taking responsibilities as an advocate for Humanity, Global warning, and education, etc.  This book is a recommendation for all to read including his other book or video, Requiem for the American Dream."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"Let Oberon do all the talking, and kill off Granuaile; One can see her PC stupidity coming from a long way off. She has become a  worthless character."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Magic might not be enough to get Harry Dresden out of trouble in Jim Butcher's Storm Front. Take one private detective, a heavy dose of magic, intriguing murders, and a splash of humor and you have the recipe for this delightful novel. Harry Dresden uses his wizarding skills to solve cases, and his self-deprecating humor, intelligence, and good nature make him a character a reader can relate to. The action moves the book at a good pace, and I found myself smiling and even laughing out loud. I feel like we've scratch the surface of this fantastic world Butcher has created. I'm thrilled to discover we have a lot more books to read in The Dresden Files. Storm Front by Jim Butcher is a must read for those people who enjoy urban fantasy and detective mysteries."
Books_5,5.0,OR,Great book on Scientology. Couldn't put it down. It does a very good job of talking about the history of Scientology and its founder L Ron Hubbard.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"An exceptional book that details the lives of two great leaders during the Indian Wars of the mid 19th century.  Ambrose provides perspective on the thinking and experience of both ""generals"" that lead to the battle of the Little Big Horn and subsequent murder of Crazy Horse.  For readers who are familiar with Custer and Crazy Horse this book adds detailed background in todays battle terms as well as the development of the thought process of both individuals that ultimately lead to their demise.  An outstanding book that is a must read for students of the history of the settling of the Great Plains."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I read this book at least ten years ago and I loved it then and still enjoyed reading it again this week. Years ago, I remember thinking to myself, why have they not turned this three part series into the next movie trilogy. You already have an awesome storyline in a still mega-popular franchise. What is Hollywood waiting for?  I'd pay to see it, for sure."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I adore this. I'm not entirely sure why, I just know it strikes me as intelligent and forward and I love the varied perspectives and how clear and vivid they all are."
Books_5,3.0,OR,I recommend starting at beginning of series.  Progression of characters most interesting angle.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I am addicted to the Bill Gastner Mysteries.  I've read every one and have gone on to read the continuing saga in the series entitled Posadas County.  The author has developed a group of citizens living and working in Posadas who have varied, realistic, interesting and entertaining  personalities. Very quickly the reader is drawn into the events taking place and into the lives of those involved.  There are usually, if not always, two ""mysteries""  to solve in each book.  The author weaves them together throughout the story without giving away the hows and whys until the end.

This series is well worth your time to read and enjoy.  Soon the little town of Posadas and it's citizens will become real to you as they did to me."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"I need to separate the story (love DL Sayers) and the presentation.  This book is nowhere close to being presentable as formatted.  Many words or missing and no attempt has been made to edit the kindle edition to fix this issue.  Please, if you're expecting a publish-ready novel to read, DO NOT GET THE KINDLE EDITION."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Really strongly recommend this book.  If you are annoyed because someone ""foreign"" is slow to catch on, find out what is really going on...."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Although Salander singlehandedly can save most series, this one was a stretch.  The characters are shallow, the dialogue is nonexistent, and the story is told, not allowed to develop."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"The book is very biased, it focuses on the topics it wants to promote and leaves out some big pieces of 2012 election."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Another great book by Ms Miller.  This was a different setting for this story, not being in cowboy country but she did really well in San Francisco and Portland.  Really wish this was just the first of a series."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I liked the story.  I thought it was well written, even though I was confused in the beginning about who was talking in each chapter.  It gets clearer as you get to know the characters.  I liked the twists, the characters, the beginning and the end.  Very good read."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Somebody to Love is the third book in the Cupid, Texas series by Lorie Wilde.  Jericho Chance is a sexy cowboy turn scholar.  He knows what he wants from life and how he is going to get it.  The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.

Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.  I will be picking up the other books in the series shortly."
Books_5,5.0,OR,I am never disappointed when I read  a Karen Kingsbury book!!  She pulls you right in from the beginning and the only problem at the end is that you do not want the story to be completed!
Books_5,5.0,OR,This is a rivetting book and hard to put down.  It would make a great motion picture.  Not only is the story compelling but I learned so much about art restoration.  The book is very well researched. There are a number of emotional issues which are well drawn.  Kudos.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I adore the 'Lord Peter' series of books by Dorothy Sayers. I found this to have a darker feel to it than most - perhaps due to the lowering skies under which it's set. The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.

Incidentally, the story does not involve clothing or any form of haberdashery."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Nothing too fabulous here.  Plus, we got the paperback through Scholastic and it cost only a couple dollars."
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I wanted to love this. Shoot, I wanted to like it. I've read and reread all the Amelia Peabody books for decades now; they are hands down my favorite fiction. Regretfully, The Painted Queen just doesn't cut it. It feels as if the characters are reading off a really bad script. It's painful to read. I finally resorted to just skimming, and I closed the book with relief at the end. There will always be a blank space on the shelf where this novel falls chronologically. I commend Joan Hess for trying; it was a difficult undertaking that would have been impossible for anyone to complete."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I was reluctant to try this process, feeling a bit snobby as a mid-career artist with a BFA and MFA in painting. I was leery of sappiness of this program. But finding myself frustrated with my work, feeling too tightly wound and over analytical, it was just the anecdote I needed. In some ways this program is the counterbalance to my MFA program which I finished 15 yrs ago and left me firmly planted in my brain - thinking, thinking, thinking - over thinking. This book helped me to create again through my intuition and to trust my instincts. I'm certainly not suggesting that thought and analysis are not important integral parts of art making which is at its core problem solving. But I do agree with the premise that artistic ""block"" stems from living too much in your brain.

The book gives you simple weekly and daily exercises that are reflective and thoughtful. There is plenty of talk of ""god"" or ""spirit"" ""source"" or ""universe"" but it also clarifies that you may simply substitute in ""creative intuition"" or ""muse"" or some such term if you are not comfortable with the religious undertones. For me this was uncomfortable at first, given that I was totally in my rational head, but this sort of leap of faith is just what I needed. Some of the exercises did not apply as well to me, but I can almost always find some benefit, even if small. Many are cathartic. The daily process of the morning pages is both a grueling task and a revelation.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this process for any creative person, no matter what ""level"" you have achieved thus far. There is always room to grow and learn, and this is a provocative and enriching experience."

Books_5,3.0,OR,Was disappointed in this book hard for me to follow
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a classic read for me as it was my first fantasy novel. Hence it is a classic novel for me and very sentimental. I recently hunted down a reprint as I had lost a large volume of my original reads and re read the book. The story is a light fantasy read, but extremely entertaining. The plot and characters are creative, and the writing is descriptive and enjoyable. Lawrence portrays the main character as distinctly human in his attributes and flaws which is a breath of fresh air from other novels. Presenting a character that could be you or me or anyone, thrust into an adventure unwillingly and forced to play the cards as fate deals them. I also enjoy Lawrence' very non-linear and unorthodox story lines. He's very creative with coming up with non-traditional fantasy elements and weaving them together into a very solid story. You can see more of this in his other novels such as ""cyborg and the sorcerers"", or the overman series, but also here as well. I recommend this novel to anyone."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"The writers are masters at the craft of building and writing stories. They have done a great job.

There is in the back cover a review from a ""top"" screenwriting teacher saying that ""Writing the Picture"" is the best book on screenwriting. It probably is. If you're serious about learning the craft this book will give you a solid education. You will constantly be coming back to it as an essential guide.

Whenever I have a question about scene cards, I read this book again.
Whenever I have a question about genres, I read this book again.
Whenever I have a question about format, description, dialogue, character, world, sequences, readers, etc. I read this book again!

Books_5,2.0,OR,"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

Tip to those reading it now: you only need to read the first one to two sentences of each paragraph to get the pertinent information. The rest of it is just filler."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed this book.  I loved the main character and that fact that she stuck out as a misfit in the society that she found herself thrust into.  It was thrilling as each moment the main characters found themselves together they became more entangled in their attraction to each other.  The last bit was a delightful twist.  I didn't see that twist coming and it lead perfectly into the ""happily ever after"" resolution."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have recently bought this book along with a couple of Osprey on British and French infantry tactics during Napoleonic wars.

Put it very briefly, get this book instead of the Ospreys. It covers not only infantry, cavalry, artillery but also naval warfare. The book gives numerous lively examples and accounts about the different achievements of each arm. One can find numerous battles explained with maps, each detailing the successes of a particular use of cavalry, artillery or infantry.

This little book does extremely well in its own modest and pedagogical way what others more convoluted writings fail to achieve: inspire!

As a conclusion: a well written and engaging entry level book. Happy with it and will read it again with pleasure."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"yes, I liked this book which I plan to give to my grand daughter. From England, there were terms I understood ( like ""jumper"" for sweater) but wondered if a kid in the US would ""get"". Not a problem- a good learning tool., Or ""wee"" instead of ""pee"".

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Olivia Harcourt will do anything to protect her late stepsister's little girl, Jamie, but with danger licking at their heels, she's going to need help from a group of shifters called the Watchmen. Jamie is a special type of witches breed and her power is coveted by more dangerous, powerful beings who kill anyone who gets in their way. Tiger-shifter Aiden Shrader is one of the Watchmen assigned to them, and an instant attraction develops between Olivia and him. Forced to drive a long distance trip to safety, they can't help being around each other, nor stop the desire flaming.

Aiden was raised by a horrid man who sexually abused him. Finally able to get away, he doesn't consider himself worthy of any woman, especially a human one. Yet, he will go to any lengths to protect Olivia, even die for her if he has to. Hot on their heels are the bad demons and undeadlies. Can Aiden and his fellow Watchmen stop them from capturing or hurting Olivia and Jamie? Will Aiden be able to hide his tiger-shifter powers from being exposed to Olivia and thus, frightening her? Or does the thought of unleashing the cat underneath his skin make her purr?

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd. For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end. A major bonus point for the author providing a list of glossary of terms so as to not confuse the reader, especially since if, like me, this is your first foray into the Watchmen series. It made it easy to catch up to speed. A fascinating tale, be sure to consider picking up a copy of Touch of Seduction"
Books_5,1.0,OR,"Even if someone gives you The Swede for free, it's not worth your time.  The book comes highly recommended, and it's a Scandinavian thriller, so I was ready to enjoy reading it from beginning to end.  Unfortunately, the plot is poorly constructed and impossible to believe (even for a summer book), and the one-dimensional characters made it a real struggle just to finish.  (To be fair, Ben - the gay lover, is interesting.)

The anti-American tone didn't bother me, but the lack of subtlety or cleverness certainly did.  Here's a sample sentence:  ""Like other Americans, he jingled coins in his pocket and constantly asked for more ice in his drinks.""  Shouldn't the author (or translator) have used ""some"" or ""many"" instead of ""other?""  Is it really possible that every American fits this description?

But that's far less important than the bad plot and characters.  Take my advice, and skip this one."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"As usual, Harry Bosch is a fascinating enigma; Michael Connelly is a master at the police procedural. It is New Years Day and a dog finds a bone in the Hollywood Hills. The dogs owner, a physician, knows the bone is human  a 10 to 12 year-old boy.

Thus begins an intriguing case that makes lots of hard turns. The murder occurred 20 to 25 years before and the victim was brutalized on a regular basis.

The case is fascinating, Harrys love interest and their relationship is not. Julia, a boot, is a mature woman who went through the police academy months earlier.

As sharp as Harry is, he begins a relationship with her rather quickly  even though it is against LAPDs policy for a supervisor and new recruit to be romantically involved. I just didn't feel that the relationship was real; the interactions seemed wooden.

One of the things that I like about Michael Connelly is that he isn't afraid to take chances with his main character, Harry. The case provides one surprise after another but the ending was a shocker.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling."

However, I found myself quite surprised at how enjoyable the book was to read.  The characterization seemed more real, and the plot did not get bogged down at all.

This book, and hopefully a series of books, will provide good adventure with a mix of Bible teaching.  No, they aren't going to be deep works of fiction, but still very enjoyable to read.  To me, it was like Indiana Jones, but with a Christian twist!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a book that you will want to re-read.  It is complex and ambiguous, so it takes time to ponder over clues and come up with theories as to what exactly happened and what it means.

I will say that the first novella in the book is a very strong, intriguing start.  The second novella describes an alien society.  It is probably a bit perplexing on the first read through, but it is still an entertaining read and you will at least get the overall picture.

I'd recommend this book to any serious science fiction reader, or any serious reader who likes science fiction occasionally.  If you don't like science fiction, you might have a knee jerk reaction to the book just because of its genre.

I would recommend Wolfe's ""the book of the new sun"" first, but this is still a great work that merits a 5 by itself."

* Something would blow up.
* Stephanie would not be driving the same car at the beginning and end of the book.
* Grandma Mauzer would go to at least one viewing at the funeral home.
* Stephanie would sleep with both the men in her life.
Well, I was right. This book is chick-lit-lite -- it took one evening to read and while enjoyable there was nothing that knocked my socks off. And it's getting hard to justify spending the money to buy the book instead of waiting to check it out of the library or borrowing it from a friend. In fact, I would recommend either of those options if you have not already purchased the book.
It is time for Stephanie to make a decision and move on. Let this series end at 20 and call it a day.
It's time for Stephanie Plum to grow up, her stupidity is getting tiresome.
Let 19 be the book where she makes a choice and 20 be the wedding. It's time."

I have researched her books and put the titles in order and am thrilled to have found another author who writes such endearing tales.  I would put her right up there with Patrick Taylor and his Irish Country Doctor books.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I really loved reading this book.  I became  immersed in a foreign culture very dissimilar to mine in many of its strict gender behavior and religious expectations but, at the same time, composed of very human, very plausible characters with whom I could empathize.  Slowly getting to know the characters, piecing them together, and wondering who were the good and bad guys, all had me on the edge of my chair wanting to know more.  Particularly fascinating were the female characters and how each dealt with the constraints placed upon them in a society where a woman's sexuality is such a preoccupation that it has to be hidden and controlled, and where the males do not seem to generally take responsibility to control their own (although one of the main male characters was very sensitive to these issues and torn by guilt and angst by his own self-perceived transgressions against the true spirituality of Islam, and his desire to treat the woman he wanted with the highest regard).  Meeting strong women who wanted to develop themselves professionally in a male-dominated culture that generally blocked that from happening was refreshing and touched my heart.  I applauded them and those males who supported them, wishing to truly respect their intelligence and not exploit  or demean them (although there were those who did).  All of the characters were unique and very engaging, with the no-nonsense, dedicated and very wise investigator, Osama Ibrahim (was the name, Osama, chosen deliberately, to create a more balanced association with it?), being my favorite.  Also extremely fascinating was gaining entre into the desert environment, and modern man's attempt to master it and treat it as a wilderness adventure.  I highly recommend this mystery novel, one that stands out in a genre that has no short supply of reading choices."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Actually, having attended a number of academic conferences myself, I am not sure this is a satire. Quite a few of the ""fictitious"" presentations in this book sported titles (and contents) that were uncomfortably familiar. (What can I say? I was young...I didn't know any better...)  As for the back-biting, infighting, petty scheming, feuds, and general unmitigated nastiness--it's all too true. Fortunately, in Lodge's hands, it's also funny enough to take the sting out of some of the more pointed barbs.

And, if Lodge's lampoon of academia isn't enough to tickle your funny bone, you'll surely get a laugh out of the misguided kidnapping, adultery, unrequited love, requited love, strippers, porn, a journey around the world, and one of the most hilarious scenes in print (a karaoke bar in Tokyo that was definitely lost in translation).

Lodge's writing is a pleasure to read. He is clever (without being precious), ironic, poignant, even lyrical in places. As befitting a novel about literary criticism, there are references to everyone we know and love: Shakespeare (All's Well That Ends Well), Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Ernest--the twins are found in a Gladstone bag), and, naturally, the Grail Quest with all of its incumbent post-modernist/feminist permutations. I was thoroughly delighted to see that Lodge even referenced himself. (On page 280 Angelica's father bemoans the ignorance about identical twins. He mentions that he ""didn't have the patience"" to read a novel which featured identical twins of opposite sexes. The novel was David Lodge's ""Changing Places."")

You will find this book gut-wrenchingly funny if you are in academia.  If you are not, well, just enjoy your flight."

I felt some of the language was a little stilted, but that's understandable because of the era in which it was written. It was even more interesting to read that Caspary was not happy with some of the choices Hollywood made when adapting the book for the screen. It's a good story and well told."

If you're looking for something that is just for the kids, or for a family that is more advanced than most, this might be it.

The other thing I would like to mention is that it comes with a ton of accessories. The kit comes with a few different numbers, but most of them are to show how many pieces you have. The instructions are also helpful if you want to add a different piece to the kit."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,"So where do I start?

First off, I need to make sure I get the correct size so I can fit the gun in the right position. This is a very large gun, so it's not really a problem. If you are going to use it as a full sized gun, it's a good idea to get a larger size. If you are going to use it for a kid, it's a good idea to get a larger size.

Secondly, if you have a kid who is going to be a little bit older, you need to be careful not to break it off. If you have a kid who is going to be a little bit younger, you may want to take the gun apart. This can be difficult for them to handle, but it's a good idea to put the gun back in the right place.

Thirdly, I need to get the correct size for the gun. I've had some issues with the paint being a bit on the gun and the gun's head not coming off. I'll update this post if I find a better solution.

All in all, I was very happy with this purchase!  It's a great toy!  It's very nice quality, and it's perfect for little hands!Very fun.  Will buy again.This is a good toy for my 2 year old.  She loves to play with it."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,"Word A Round consists of a set of pieces, which are either left or right handed.  The pieces are not very detailed, but they are designed to be easy to take apart and assemble.  A little smaller than the size of a regular round, but still a fun toy for the little ones.  They love the fact that they can be attached to the pieces so they can take turns.  This is not a big deal for us, because it is a very simple toy that we have to play with.  The pieces are made of solid wood, so the kids can play with it, but we like that it doesn't fall apart when put together.  We love the fact that it is made of a soft material, and not of plastic.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,CG,"I have gotten more of this than I thought I would. I also have the Clue. If you want to get a solid idea of the game, you can get it here. I have heard that the game is very similar to the one I played. The Clue is a great way to get familiar with the concept of the game. It has all the different pieces that you can see in the game and you can play with a group of people. The game is played by a group of people, but the game is about a group of people playing a game. It is more like a group of people playing a game. The game is fairly simple, but the basic rules are simple enough for you to understand. I think it is a good game to play with the group of people who are going to play. You can't really mess things up with the people who are going to play with you, but the people who are going to play with you will get bored of it very quickly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game to play with friends or family. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is not going to get bored with the game at first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it! She is obsessed with the piano and loves it! It's a great size for her hands and her head! It's really cute and she loves it."

The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up. The little one will probably love it for a while. I would buy this again, but maybe for a few more years.My son loves this car!  It is very well made and looks great on the wall.  It is a little pricey for what it is, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for him.  My son will love it!Very cute, very well made, really cute.  I would buy again, but this one is a bit of a disappointment.  I would recommend this to anyone with kids.  The paint job is very good, and the plastic is very durable.

The sound is great and the colors are vibrant.  I would highly recommend this toy.I bought this for my grand-daughter who is 6 months old.  She loves it!  She was a little disappointed when she opened it.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because she can't hold the pieces in her hands.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This was a Christmas gift to my 8 year old and he loves it.  We set it up Christmas day and then left for a few days.  When we came back one of the cars wouldn't operate as it did before we left.  We did some switched batteries and tried some minor problem solving but the car just wouldn't work correctly.  Contacted the company and received a prompt response back.  Did the steps as was recommended to us from Tech Support and then gave them the results.  They again responded promptly and advised that they would need to send out a calibration tool but with the holidays and such we wouldn't have it until after the 1st of the year.  No problems here.  Rec'd the calibration tool earlier than I expected and performed the steps that were supplied and everything works great!  Couldn't be happier with the support we rec'd.  ...and love this racetrack.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I believe I bought this set from Amazon when my son was 3, and it was the best investment I ever made!  If I had known how great these cups were, I'd have bought them at the beginning.  I've tried every brand out there, and these are by far my favorite.  They do not leak if you take the time to tighten them properly, and I give 10 stars to the spillproof parts...all others I've tried are impossible to really clean properly, and you end up having to replace those parts repeatedly if you lose track of a cup and have it get yucky.  I love these cups because all of the portions of the spillproof apparatus come completely apart so you can sterilize all the parts sufficiently before reassembling the cup.  I put the parts in a compartment of my dishwasher and use the sanitize cycle.  My son rides a school bus with me all day, and he was in the habit of slinging his cup of milk to watch the dribbles land on the walls and seats.  This made for a huge stinky mess to clean up.  He would do the same thing on long car trips in my personal vehicle when he was bored.  I'd have little white dots all over my windows and seats.  I bought these cups in the hope that they would *TRULY* be spillproof, as in he would no longer be able to ""sling"" milk from them.  Alas!  He can't do that with these cups!  I LOVE THESE!  I highly recommend them."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a gift requested by my grandson for his birthday.  We have used real dominoes to do this, but without the props.  Some reviews say the parts are flimsy, so be forewarned.  This is for an older child who is not hard on his toys."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"My daughter liked the included doll and pet (note its only 1 pet, not 3 like the Amazon description says). She didn't like the house itself much and i cant blame her. Its a cute little house but one that is badly made.

You pretty much need to assemble everything which is a pain. I'd say it would be a good exercise for a kid but my 12 year old couldn't assemble it on her own. I probably spent 45min assembling it. Alot of the pieces didn't properly snap on and i have no doubt it will pop off with continual play. The door is horrendous, it easily open ands doesnt stay closed. The background of the house inside is just a cardboard you slot in. The finished product is a good size; not too big or too small.

They included like 50 small stickers and my daughter loves stickers though so she did have alot of fun sticking them on the house and customizing it. She is also having alot of fun with the mobile app. But in the end, i wouldnt recommend this. If you kid really wants a LPS toy i would pass on this."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Expect to crash and replace stuff. It is very durable otherwise. It is extremely susceptible to crosswinds and has no ailerons.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,It's a well-made toy but my 7 month old doesn't really care for it.  If I push the button she'll watch the balls move but it doesn't really hold her interest. Occasionally she'll just kind of pick it up and shake it. She's hit into it more times than she's actually played with it so it's probably done more harm than good in the 2 months I've owned it!

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,I have to use it as a PC link instead of a field programmer. My Castle Link quick connect does not allow this to function independently of a computer. I imagine it would work perfectly if I wired it directly to the ESC though.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"This was one of the last gifts opened because it looked like a lot of work! We got it for 3 year olds and probably should have waited a year! Not all Hotwheels fit in the Turbo shooter thing, and the track does not hold together too well when cars come out of it and are sent into the u turn.
Th etracks were easy to put together, and I think this was a good starter package , especially for the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Greata ngrandson loves his new Elmo, it goes everywhere with him.  He is learning how to sing along with Elmo.  Great learning toy."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this for my 5 year old, and he LOVES it. Let's start with the good:

1. The pictures on the dice are fun and great for a Mario fan.
2. This is a great game to help younger kids who are learning to add and write numbers. It is also good in that it helps teach strategy.
3. Adults can have fun playing as well since we remember this game from when we were young.
4. Everything fits nicely in the question mark box when you are done playing.

The not so good:

1. I had to coat the dice with clear nail polish as a preventative measure to keep the graphics from wearing off (thank you to the reviewer who suggested that)
2. The score cards are really small and for a little kid trying to write numbers, it can be hard to fit the writing into the space allotted. But I have to say that I don't think the score cards are all that much smaller than the yahtzee we used to play. And, as someone else pointed out, the pages are easily scanned and enlarged. The only problem there is that larger papers would not fit so neatly in the box.
3. There is a glaring typo on the scorecard. Not a big deal for adults, but confusing for a five year old.

Overall, for the price, you will get hours of enjoyment from this game. And even if it is not the most durable or well made game, for under 20 dollars, I think it is fine. Especially if you have a Mario fan!"
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"We like this electronic version alright. The convenience of the cards and electronic banking make game play faster and smoother, but this game is very different. Life tiles have been replaced with action cards and the action cards are so different. They may say something like ""Have a dance contest with another player."" and both will spin the wheel and highest number takes the prize. With younger children this will be great. I imagine they will enjoy it and the focus on family bonding for this version is awesome. However for just adults playing it's a bit too young. Also the values are crazy. I believe there's a card that says throw uncle max a birthday party pay 50K! Must have been some party! Obviously the older versions had exaggerated prices but this one is even more so. The only real complaint I have is that mine came in a cheap and very thin cardboard box with flaps, not in a shoe box style box like most board games. Ours has already ripped and we now keep the game in a basket."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My children play with this toy every time it is in the tub but quickly move onto something else.  Also the spinning piece comes off, so it spend most of the time on the bottom of the tub.  Unless the battery was packed separately and I missed it, the toy we got came without the battery (the compartment was empty).

Update: this toy broke just after few times of play.  No fountain and no spinning anymore..."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,Granddaughter loved it but I thought it was too expensive for what you get.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This 2015 version of Mattel's My Password Journal has some significant improvements over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-old-version/dp/B00IVFCCMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the old version</a>.

For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition.  Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.

Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.  It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/old-fashioned-locking-diary/dp/B00NYAGMQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">old-fashioned locking diary</a>&nbsp;may be a better bet.  For the gadget girl who likes to fiddle with tech this is a fun toy, complete with invisible(-ish) ink, a ""hidden"" (in the most obvious way) compartment, and the namesake verbal password.  The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.

Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-)."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I LIKE THIS ITEM, FULL DETAILED, VERY GOOD FOR PAPO. Is really a Dinosaur very interesting and very educational for all people because is made exactly  and is very realistic when one is close of him. Thanks you to Papo for your great job"
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"The images themself are fun, but the printing is poor. It appears they were printed in layers of blues, reds and yellows to make each ocean animal image, but the printing didn't overlap perfectly to make a crisp picture. You can see a bit of each primary color around the edges of each animal, thus making the finer details (like eyes and little fins) fuzzy. There were also thin black lines streaking thru the images.
Also, these 13 images are printed on two large plastic sheets (like a plastic table cloth), so you need to cut them apart with scissors. I thought I was getting a ready-to-use product, and it added unanticipated time."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Nice, affordable base sets that work well with Lego, KRE-O, etc."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Did the job, looked good but entirely too over priced."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is my 4 months old favorite toy. His eyes light up when he hears him or seems him. It has so many different colors, textures, patterns, sounds...it's really just the best toy I've found. I've gotten them as gifts for expecting mothers. Definitely buy this."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Scared everyone who's come across them (on their desks, on the floor, table...). You'd easily mistake them for real cockroaches"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,More great additions to your train set.  My grandson loves TrackMaster 2 track.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Purchased for my desk at work.  Makes me smile lol.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This car is awesome and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who may be looking at it as a gift for the holidays. Your kids will love it's 360 degree spinning action! Both customer service & shipping exceeded expectations. The battery I was not too thrilled with but it plainly states in the details that it only lasts for up to 8-10 mins of play before recharging. Definitely recommend buying an extra battery so you can still play while the other battery is charging. definitely would buy from again!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Bought these to go with other gift for oldest Great-Granddaughter's Christmas present. They are adorable !!  The winged ones are small but I know she will love them.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,The Stella doll diaper bag is precious. It is very well made and a perfect size for a toddler.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my sons 15th birthday. He loves it and has a lot of fun. It flies VERY high for a toy and the camera is awesome. You download the app and use as the control screen. Very easy to lose, its white."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Nice, relatively easy puzzle for 4-year old.  Does light up in dark!  Very fun"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,These are awesome prizes! It comes in a good box to that I plan on keeping & using. There's is alot of prizes & different kinds. I like to use prizes instead of candy for easter. So these won't fit in Easter eggs but my kids are going to bring me their eggs & exchange them for prizes this yr. I know my kids will really like these. Good quality as well.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

All in all it's a fun little game for the very youngest of gamers at a cheap price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I LOVE IT!!! That is all....

No, Really what I mean to say is that this is a great product. Charizard is one of my favorite Pokemon. I love the promo card and the oversized version of it. It comes with 4 booster packs: Two XY packs and Two Flashfire packs. I've only opened the Flashfire packs and got some good pulls from them.

If you know someone who loves Pokemon and loves Charizard, definitely get this for them."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Holds about a hundred dice! Excellent pathfinder companion! I bought them to hold all the dice we use in the game and works great!
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,I feel like it's overpriced for what you get. It is nice to get everything in one package but I was able to find plates of the same quality at the dollar store.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a pack of fun parking violation tickets that are great for a gag or white elephant gift. Sometimes you just need to remind someone that they did a crappy job parking, and these will get your point across and probably put a smile on their face."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Motorcycle is pretty fast for the price.  However as previously mentioned on other reviews, the turning radius is poor.  Additionally, it doesn't work well outdoors unless it is on super smooth pavement.  The result is that we have to use it indoors.  If you add that fact in with the poor turning radius and fast speed, you need a pretty good amount of indoor space to have a lot of fun.

With that said, all my nephews fought over it all Christmas morning for a chance to play with it.  I would give it 5 stars if the turning radius was better or if it was more versatile with outdoor use.  I would buy it again as the kids loved it and was great value for the money."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I got this in the mail when they said it will come.  I was really excited to try it and see if it really worked, and it does!  It is great, I love it.  My only problem is that the mirror part really is very easy to scratch.  It warned not to put anything metal in it so that it won't scratch, but of course I did (a ring, some earings) so that was my fault.  But I've had it for two days, and it scratched really quickly.  Not major scratches though, just little tiny ones.  Overall, it's a great product."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Purchased these stickers for the kids play with while we were out at dinner or on a long car ride. All 3 kids loved them. Children ages 8, 3 and 2. The stickers are very detailed and full of so many different colors. I love the fact that the stickers are not repetitive. I ended up using some on the kids lunch notes I write and put in their lunch box. They came home and said how much they loved them and requested that I surprise them with the Peppa  stickers on their notes all the time. Needless to say I'm going to need to restock very soon :) Great product!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Catty Noir is always a standout with her hot pink hair. Seeing her in this series is cool.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My daughter seems to not get the hang of it.  She almost looks too big for it (she's 2) or the product seems to not inflate all the way (but we've inflated it to the max, where it seems like it's about to burst).  She falls off easily and doesn't bounce well on it.  I thought it would be like the videos but instead of bouncing up and down my daughter seems to lose her balance on it quickly.  Maybe it's just because when I first gave this to my daughter she was still trying to balance out having a large head (don't toddlers look like cute bobble heads, lol) but her balancing skills are much better now.  I'll try to give it to her again and see if she can play with it more now.  Before she would bounce and go flying off the thing but I think she's gotten more skills at balancing the past 4 months and will be able to use this more in the spring.  I like it because it's adorable and seems like it will be a ton of fun once she gets used to the concept.  She really does have fun on it the times I let her play but I always have to put pillows around her and be on alert in case she falls.  As she gets older though she'll have a blast."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought two of the Sugar Puppy Surprises, one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and one for my 6 year old niece, for Christmas and they love them and haven't put them down! I had one as a kid and was thrilled when I saw they were remaking these and kept the look of the ones from 20 years ago instead of revamping the look like they do with all the remake toys. Sugar has very soft fur and I love the sparkly strands throughout her purple hair. The stitching on the dog is very well done and it seems durable.

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit. They are very expensive on here and can be found cheaper at Target or Toys R Us. Simple but very fun toy and hands down their favorite gift this year!"
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"The product is great. What is NOT is I chose the ""package of 2"" and only got one."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Love this product great for big Legos or baseplate or long bricks but would not put anything small in it because there is a gap around the bottoms that the lil Legos can fall in . But they do hold a lot
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Product was received as described and the quality of the product was excellent. I would recommend this product to others.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The Lego Connoisseur Here, Reviewing the Snowspeeder.

True to my beliefs, we picked this up for $25.00 at Legoland.  Less than $0.10 a brick!

Believe it or not, we bought this for a three year old, hey it was Legoland and we were in the moment!  Probably should of known better all things considered...This Lego set feels very strong when built--durable even, through many battle simulations it has survived harsh environments and many gun shots!  Until his other brother shot it down with a fanfare of no other.  Not recommended for little kids since most battles end with a request for a rebuild, much to parents dismay.  However the largest one (ahem...) loves this Lego Star Wars Set.

First, it is a relatively older set.  I remember it when I was boy.  My friend had it (and all the other ones too).  Tons of fun, decent instructions to go along with it, but not quite as user friendly as the newer more, ""step by step"" instruction designs.  This felt more true to the old movie than many other sets without as many custom parts as those tend to have.  Plus Luke, with a light-saber is always awesome.

The few complaints I have is related to the cockpit...There really isn't enough room.  I wish they had built it up a little more so that the fighters could sit up straight.  I also which that Luke had some spot to put his light-saber in the cockpit.  I think the spring-shooting darts are a bit too sensitive, they went off several times without much input from me.  And finally, the little shooter by the grappling hook can easily fall out and it isn't exactly the easiest piece to put back on."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,poor quality control. pieces were cracked upon receipt. still cute though.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,I like the idea of this but it was hard for my preschooler to get the cards into it.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Big hit with the kids and you can tell it's modeled after Pandemic so it makes for a solid game for the adults too.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"What's not to love? Another quality plush from Fiesta!

This 36"" octopus is very nicely constructed, and has awesome little details. The fabric used is super soft. Its eyes are huge, and have a very nice follow-me effect. Great size for cuddling with, using as a pillow, or just chilling with. It seems to be out retired now, but it's worth acquiring if you collect plush or just enjoy octopi."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Great toy for the beginner user of remote controls. However it does have limited movements. Also be sure to turn off when not in use because it will kill the batteries in between uses. All in all a good buy.
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"Very disappointed in this product. Couldn't wait to get it. Everything ""sticks"" in it"
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,One word describes this. JUNK. Do not waste your money your better off buying a lottery ticket.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"The Bloco product consists of a few cutout sheets of foam, as well as some connectors. I'll grant that it's clever, and the dragons are fairly neat when fully constructed. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. First of all, there are a large number of pieces - 230 doesn't seem like that much, but many of them are small and even hard to find. My 6 year old was overwhelmed, so I had to piece the things together. Moreover, I suspect that the instruction sheet would be a bit much for a 10 year old, working alone to interpret - let alone a 6 year old. If you look at the picture of the kids on the Bloco page, they still have their baby teeth - so they're marketing to younger kids. The foam itself is, by and large, pretty thick and durable, although there are a couple sheets of thinner form that easily tears as well. In some cases, however, removing the smaller foam holes and pieces can be difficult. Regardless, separating the pieces in the foam sheets took a good amount of effort, and assembling both dragons took around 90 minutes - for an adult. The toy itself was OK. If your child likes Legos they'll probably like this as well. In my case, once the novelty of the newly-built dragons wore off, the toy was largely forgotten. So while the Bloco Dragons are offered at a good price, and some kids will love them, I can't give them an unqualified ""thumbs up."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Wonderful item. Great height for toddlers! My son is almost 18 months and enjoys this item very much! I highly recommend it :)
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Nice size balloon. It is still inflated 3 weeks later. He kids loved playing with it. Overall I am happy with the quality of the product.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Cute, easy to learn/play game for the kids. My 6 year old loves playing with her friends"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My son is a huge Cars fan.  He has decided he wants the entire Radiator Spinrgs set.  Though I do not think the quality is that great, my son loves it and places with it daily.  As a parent I can see the flaws (the car doesn't jump the 8, there really isn't much to this piece of the set, etc), my son feels the exact opposite.  At the end of the day, the child is happy playing with his cars on the set."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I have the original game which I love and I thought that I'd buy the other continents for 2 reasons:
1.  others collect all the games so there must be some reason to want more of basically the same game.
2.  I wanted to use it to help my son learn the main places in africa (we used the original one to learn where main towns in the US/Canada were)
and my opinion?
re: reason #1...There is one added dimension, which is fun, and of course a different map that has a lot of cities that I'm unfamiliar with so it really twisted my brain, which is good, I guess.  But overall, I'm not sick of the first game enough to really need a second similar one yet.  If I was in the mood for ticket to ride, I would have just as happily played the first one....
re: reason #2...Although my son over time might become more familiar with some important cities in africa over time and have a basic idea where they would be, I feel that knowing which country they are in is very important and the lines showing the different countries are not there.  Also, many of the cities are ones that I don't feel he NEEDS to know, and finally, it's only the bottom half of the continent.

end opinion: I like the game but wish that I would not have spent so much money on a game that didn't really fulfill my needs.  I wish that it was all of africa, with countries identified, and only the most widely known cities in all of africa."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Great for any homeschooling family or anyone trying to teach their children at home.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Good game for laughs, quick thinking, and language expression skills (from a speech therapist view)"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This Webkinz was a great gift! The recipient loved it and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good gift! It arrived in great packaging and there seemed to be no damage. The quality was great and it should last for a long time!
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,This is really great battery. My son is able to use it for 20-25 mins per charge with his remote car.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Bought this for a costume for my son. He loved it. Very durable and awesome for any cosplay.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My kids LOVE this beanie boo!!  It's so cute and cuddly. The small size (approx. 6"") makes is very portable too! I have already bought 10+ of these beanie boos to give as gifts!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"A really fun addition to any birthday party. We got it for my 4 year old son's birthday. Took 5 minutes to blow up with air compressor. Took a little time to deflate but not a big deal. Just let it slowly deflate over the course of a day or two. Will definitely be able to use again. For the price, it is a ton of wow factor because it is pretty big. If you have access to an air compressor and are considering buying this, just buy it. You won't regret it."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,Very difficult for a toddler to use. Definitely not a bold color as portrayed. Wouldn't buy these again!!!
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"1. The best thing about this globe is the gorgeous colors.  Oranges, blues, gorgeous.
2. The textured terrain is wonderful.  Very instructive for a kid to ""feel"" the mountain ranges.
3. I have two complaints:  1) when it arrived in the mail, there was a chip in the paint, so the light seeped through. If it comes new with paint chip, it's going back!  2) this globe does not spin freely, and we all know, the best fun about a globe is the spin, so a kid can spin it and randomly point her finger to see what country she should go to....  that's the fun.

So, I'm still hunting for the perfect globe for a present for my grandniece, one that lights up, has a good easy spin, and has topographical texture...  the hunt continues...

forever,

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I have picked these refills up before for my children. They are so easy to work with and since you mix them yourselves kids love to adjust the colors by experimenting with the ratios of one paint to another with the handy mixing tube supplied in the box. This mixing tube has lines marked for the quantities and makes it easy to mix and experiment.

This also supplies a great hands on learning experiment for children to understand primary and secondary colors."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This was one of the cutest items that I got for my 9 yr old daughter.  She has played w/ this more than any other food products.  It is really adorable how it comes in the tin can.  I didn't think she would like the sauce part very much but it has proven to provide much of the creative play.  I highly recomend this product!

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,You won't be disappointed in this figurine.  It's an exceptionally good quality and the features are really done well.  It's a great gift to a young teen.  My grandson age 13 really couldn't wait to get this.  He was on top of the world when it arrived.  He couldn't thank me enough.  Shows it off on his shelve proudly.  It's always good when the kids are not disappointed when they open a gift.  A little pricey but honestly for the quality it was worth it.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Rampage rocked in the movie, even though ( spoiler alert...) Bumblebee knocked his socks off, hes the first ever 4 legged transformer, and has a unique set of weapons. my disappointments were the packaging details and paint were way better than the real thing, the pistons don't actually move on their own, like other ""mech alive"" doodads, and they don't stay in place all that well, the elbows don't bend in enough directions, which is understandable because of the  limitations with where they end up in vehicle mode,  his eyes don't glow, but other than all that negativity I'm glad i paid 2-day shipping to get him. Although difficult i still recreate the movies battle scenes with him... don't ask my age."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"Described as easy to assemble, I don't think so, took me over an hour. To think about disassembling and toting this product around and reassembling again, is very unlikely. Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2. The other side of the tent isn't lined, the poles which Velcro the cover to the house at the bottom pop off. I really can't say anything nice about this item."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Hence, some parts not fitting well like elevator, but love the flat screen TV built in for cell phone."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Love these for our homeschool classroom and use them DAILY! wonderful tools for physical representation of math concepts and even story starters. good quality and tough enough to stand up to 4 kids, one of which being a toddler and one being autistic. Buying more sets soon."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,We love peppa pig. Ive read the reviews about the feet and we play hard with these and we have chipped some of the black but it doesn't take away from the fact that its PEPPA. if you want a collector item keep it in box. for the 4 year olds ask them. they don't car if their shoes are a not perfect.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Our daughter loves these, and the hard case is a nice plus!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Fun for the kids and even Myself when we do a group structure.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! It is such a great value and is perfect for beginning or intermediate young fashionistas! I am so pleased with this purchase!!
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,Not precise as far as scoring concern.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"My 2yr old received this on her 1st b-day and she loved it. This was her first experience with using crayons in the tub, and it was a treat while it lasted. My biggest complaint is that the crayons ""shorten"" rather quickly so...as they shorten, the harder it is for little and big fingers to get out. It used to frustrate her so I stopped letting her use them. Now she uses the Dorothy fish bowl as a fun water strainer. Elmo is great too, he dries quickly, overnite and he is good to use as a learning tool for the young bather."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my son's third birthday because he had just recently started watching the Rescue Bots show.  He LOVES this toy! He take it to daycare every day. I love that it's a simple toy that doesn't require lots of pieces to keep up with. It really is easy to transform back and forth. He's able to this without my help. It's also the perfect size for him---big enough to have fun with but also small enough for his little hands! He plays with this so much, I think I will be buying the other rescue bots as well!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My daughter got this for her birthday and just loves it! She is 2.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Granbaby loves it, one of his favorites.
Entertains him for a long time."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Prompt delivery - excellent material and workmanship. Doll looks comfy.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I love that the kids can create sandwiches and pocket sandwiches with these flexible, felt foods.  It's not just plastic food that is put on a plate."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"These are thin and flimsy but we only used the as party hats for a few hours. So for the price, they did what we expected. Just don't expect to get a lot of use or long term use out of them. They fit 2-8 year olds just fine."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I've actually reviewed this twice (once on it's own [...]) and once with its sister pieces ([...])

It shares a mold with the SPD Zord, is just as easy to disassemble and you can mix and match between the two. Because it's such a simple design the including the well molded (if not pained) Ranger figure and Ranger key and it's push fire gimmick actual add to it's value due to the design not really having much else to go on."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Satisfied with my purchase. Seller is serious. The product is as shown on page. recommend it.
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"It doesn't work after two times of playing and each time was like  less than ten minutes! First, it is true that it's super annoying. Constantly making noises that my kids played with it a bit and put it to sleep. After the second time put it to sleep ( with the yee mask on), it just won't wake up anymore. Changed two sets of new batteries but still not working. Returned."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Really cool, pretty detailed for a lego and lots of moving parts for what it is. Bought it for my son, he loves it"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This figure is awesome, great sculpt, detail, stellar paint job, nice articulation although somewhat limited on the arms, and the blue paint on the cockpit is a bit lacking, would of been nice if they used a slight gloss application, but all around this figure is a beast! I always preferred this jaeger to gypsy danger, it just looks more mech-like and robotic and not as streamlined as gypsy. I highly recommend purchasing this figure its well worth it, fans of pacific rim or even mech fans in general."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I had first seen this toy at a local pharmacy and almost bought it right then after seeing how great it was, but then I decided to purchase it off of Amazon as it was cheaper!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Bought for 5-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl. Love the curtain feature! I have ours turned to the side so one child can cook and take orders through the curtain while the other orders their meal. Actually helps my kids get along.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Neat game. It takes some thinking and trying to read what your opponent is trying to do.
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,We tried playing playing this game at every level and no one could get into it.
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,I liked the idea of this toy but once I received it I left it in the packaging and re-gifted it to someone else.  It seemed way to complicated for a baby and overall isn't something I would have bought had I seen it in the store.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Cute doll - looked a lot like the character from the movie. My daughter really likes it and LOVES the movie!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Amazing toy. Bought one for our 7 yr old niece and played around with it. Seems to be the hotness of 2013. But let's not lose our heads, here. It is merely a reconfigured Nerf Blaster. Instead of a trigger or a pump, you pretend to release a string. Aiming is more luck than skill. Comes with five whole darts.

If they really want to learn about archery, you'd be better served buying a simple 'starter' bow and arrow set for about the same price. Teaches them a skill AND not to shoot their friends! My dad taught me to shoot when I was young and it is still a fun and relaxing hobby for me. This will not teach them anything, but dang, it's fun!

Some advice on the price:
-This retails for abouts twenty dollars. All my local retailers were sold out, and about two hours after purchasing it from Amazon the price here more than doubled. I see a lot of annoyed shoppers giving this one star over the price and that's bad form. You don't like the price, don't buy it. Don't mislead other shoppers about this great, fun product because the vender is gouging. Amazon isn't always the best price. I've seen a few 'hot' products sold for much cheaper locally (Target, WM, TrU) and while Amazon is great for most holiday shopping, in this case, at this moment, they aren't. ALWAYS remember to price check!
-Don't be suckered into buying the 'girly' refills, the ones that match the colors of the bow. They cost more than twice the price of the regular orange ones! (Now THIS is some sexist gouging!) Kids don't care what color their ammo is and not everything girls touch needs to be pink. Save some money and pick up a pack of standard Nerf refills."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"We have the older VTech learning school bus that have survived beating for several years and kids now. That old bus was built like a tank! This new VTech bus is good but does not have the same build quality, it feels cheaper. However it does have more sounds and activities, but with that, it has a lot more pieces to lose as well.

The LO pulls out a letter and shows us and we have him say it out loud, it works, but the bus just becomes a music player / storage.

Maybe he'll get more engaged inserting the letters into the slot later on, but for now wel will use it the way we plays with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,Half of the pieces were missing magnets. Product did not meet description or expectations.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,My son will sometimes play with this ball and it talks back to him. He is 8 months old and isn't crawling yet so it is not as interesting for him as it could be if he were crawling after it but its something he can grow into.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"These batteries can be one of two ways. One can hold a charge for seven or eight minutes or thirty seconds. The added weight makes it a ""Balancing game"" If it's too far forward, the chopper won't hold a hover. It's a coin toss. I put one in my mini Chinook and it flew almost 10 minutes. In my 107g, it seemed to cause the circuit board to malfunction making the 107g fly out of control. My advice, use the same type battery that came with the chopper. Understand that these batteries will start to quit holding a charge very soon. They are like store brand batteries opposed to Energizer or Duracell. Know how to solder if you plan to replace one."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,the product i recieved was not as pictured had the wrong battery connections  ! I can not charge this or use it!
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,My son was excited to receive this until after building it there were many missing parts what a disappointment #Leanne Flashberg
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"way to little, I should have read the product details.  Also metal bars didn't fit into the base plate as the holes were not sized right."
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"We bought this for our 1.5 yr old daughter, who's about 28 inches, for Christmas and had to return it. We were looking forward to it for many reasons. However, after assembling it, she went to sit in the chair and she was gigantic for it. We had to send it back. I'm sure it's a great toy, but if your child is on the taller side of a young toddler, don't waste your time or money as the age recommendation should be lower due to the height limitations."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"the buttons are too hard to flip/push.  he gives up, and we've had it for over 6 months."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Having these Core Medals complete my collection and they make awesome sounds. Any OOO fan would be crazy to not have these in their collection.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My 5 year old loved these. Good quality and the feet bend so they can sit.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We have been so excited to test out our new kite since it arrived a few days ago.  The weather finally cooperated today, and we were able to take it out for a test run.  First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

 After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!  I am more than impressed with the durability of this kite, and would definitely recommend it.  It's prefect for children and adults.

Product was provided for a fair and honest evaluation."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,They were ok. Big pack of mini plastic horses. You can tell they are cheap. Worked well enough for table decor for daughters birthday. All wouldn't stand. A couple could not balance.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for a little girl's birthday and it was a huge success. The additional styling tools are okay, but really I payed the extra money for this doll versus the one without the additional tools because this one has a better dress that is a little truer to the actual Elsa dress with the sheer over-lay."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I've worked with kids in and out of centers for 18 years, and the no-spill paint cup is a necessity.
It cuts down on the clean up and inevitable spills associated with young ones learning to paint.
Instead of hovering and saying ""be careful!"" all the time you can let their creativity flow.
You can also leave the paint in and cover it for the next time."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Had this when I was a kid and thought it was a lot of fun. Wanted my oldest granddaughter to have one because she really likes drawing. She loves it!  I'll probably have to buy 2 more once the other to granddaughter's are old enough.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,These are really great little binoculars to use with 2-5 year old kids. We have them in several classrooms at the daycare center that I run. They can stand up to repeated ROUGH use and are a nice bright color.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This set is cut, but I don't understand why Maui has hard plastic hair while Moana has regular hair like the barbies.  If you watch behind the scenes video, you'll see how the movie company's research found that Maui's hair was very important to the Demi God, so why make the hair fake?  Anyway, my kid loves this set and it is very cute.  Any little Moana Princess or lover will really enjoy this set."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Glad to add this one to my party games collection. Some of our party participants backed out after finding out that you actually have to think during this game but after playing a few rounds and finding out how funny it is to see what everyone else wrote, they were back in! Nice game for middle schoolers and up although I did find that the scoring was a bit confusing."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My son loves these dinosaurs!!! The dinosaurs are the perfect size for little hands but big enough terrorize any action figure or plastic soldier that may happen upon them. The toys are solid and I see them lasting as long as my boy will play with them. I recommend this purchase for any dino-loving kid!
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"My daughter has a Pig pillow pal that she loves sleeping on but it's getting pretty old and worn out. This unicorn can't be laid on comfortably because of the large tail. She loves how it looks but won't use it. It's also too big to play with so for me, this was a waste of money."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Beautiful dragon, bought him for me but my daughter stole him so guess I need to get another, lol!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I bought this for my daughter last Easter. She was only 1 and a half. She LOVED it and still plays with is all the time!! Cute and easy to play with.
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,Very cheap and flimsy. Not so easy for a 4 and 6 year old to get setup sturdily. Sent it back.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This kit is fun and easy to use. We dyed 4 kids' shirts dry, which used up most of the dye. (They used several colors each!) The shirts have been laundered several times in cold water, and are still just as bright as they were when we made them. I would definitely recommend this kit. It is a good value for the price, because there are so many colors to choose from and the kit includes everything you need except the shirts."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Purchased as a gift for 8 y.o. boy--he loved it and shares it with his 6 y.o. brother
Rather easy and straightforward assembly by their dad
Quick delivery---Easel is everything promised---Recommend--Would buy it again!!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,I bought this for my son. He opened it yesterday and it is BROKEN today. He didn't do anything crazy.... it is just a poorly made toy. DON'T BUY THIS.
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,Not as good as  Fisher Price. Write very light.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Legos are Fun !!! Love watching my child build them and then use his imagination to play !!!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Arrived as scheduled and store condition quality. Great price for what you get, inclusion of three chompies and missle launchers on the copter make for an amazing set for skylanders giants or general skylander fans"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,It was perfect. Just what my kids wanted. It was great quality nothing like from a quarter machine and I would buy it again for somebody.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"These are great for a 4 year old who likes to build!  The packaging is a little disappointing, as it is a cardboard box with a plastic cover.  This does not create the type of seal I would prefer for a toy with many small parts.  The pieces themselves are occasionally tough for a child to fit together snugly.  The choices in this set are fun and clearly created for a girl, and they have instructions on how to create several options in the box that are easy to follow.
Overall this is a solid set if you have a girl who likes building and who enjoys pretend play, as it allows you to create a princess and some animal friends to play within the built structures."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Great starter set for my son. Easy to use tools and great color assortment for a starter set. My only complaint is the set of 3 plastic molds has 2 of the same casts. So instead of having 24 different shapes to mold, we actually have 16...."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I took my kids to the beach a few weeks ago and lots of kids had floaties and my kids were drawn to play with those kids since they didn't have any. I found the Jasonwell giant inflatable ice cream pool float on Amazon and thought it was adorable and that my kids would really love playing with it. When I got it we blew it up and it was easy to do, and this is big enough for both of my kids to share, its huge! Its well made and seems like it will last for a long time. This is the perfect water toy for kids!

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I have been looking for something I can do with my grandson and since he is really into Star Wars, we are going to build this together."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,I paid little so didn't expect much. Fun at first but didn't take long before it broke. My daughter would loose interest in it quickly.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 7-month-old has loved this toy since it showed up on our doorstep four months ago. He loves the sound, the little light up nose, and all the tags. I will warn you - if you take it on a car trip, bury it deep within your luggage. It'll make that ""boink!"" sound constantly and drive you absolutely insane. Lesson. Learned."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,looks good. gave as a gift not sure how it turned out.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I got this bouncer with free shipping, so very good deal. This bouncer is a nice with decent size we can put it indoor. We used electric pump and took less than 30 min to pump it. It has been in our living room for more than 2 months without the need of repumping even many kids have been to our home and played on it. It is big enough for two small kids (5 and 7 years old to play in it). We also tried filling it with 400 balls or so to let the kids to have another fun.
My son has low muscle tone, at first, he scared of playing inside. Then I used a candy reward to ask him jump inside to pick it, he then have fun in picking the candy inside the bouncer. So far, all the kids (less than 7 years old) who have come to our home enjoyed this bouncer.
We think this is a good buy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is honestly such a great toy! My almost 5yo and almost 2yo have been playing with this for over a year. It's huge! It occupies them. My son always wants to make a fort, so this is perfect. It's 2 pieces that attach together. Downtowns we just use one piece and take the red top part and cover the top. The kids have so much fun chasing each other through this. I love that it stores flat and takes up no space which is great if you live in a small house or apt. I sometimes put those crawl tunnels through it as well, which is another great thing that stores flat. It's easy to put up and take down. Tons of imaginative play!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The MOZART MAGIC CUBE, truly IS magical.  Press the ""Orchastra"" side of the cube, and various Mozart melodies are heard.  Press each individual instrument, and it goes silent, leaving the other instruments to play.  You can touch the individual instruments again, and hear them come back on.  The lights flicker as the music plays.  The batteries are a little difficult to change -- but otherwise, this toy is pure magic -- for anyone of any age!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Wish he would have loved this as much as I did but it is bright, colorful and fun!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Worth the cheap price but a lot small than I expected
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"I kept her in the box for a long while after I got her . And I finally had enough to buy me another Ikea display stand, to Separate all my Transformers and all my action play arts kai Street Fighters and Wonder Woman and Bat girl. Anyways as I was about to pose her in a action pose I moved her left arm and her joint snap off.. 1st I was like WFT.....For a 70 plus figure I expected better From a popular manufacture. Anyways I contacted the seller and We are  in the process of getting a replacement. Dam the headaches. Makes me weary of buying these figures again. And then I read some of these reviews in here and one person had the same problems as me. So I  Decided to post my own review. When I get my replacement, I'm not sure if I wanna open her up or just leave her in her box.

To the future buyers be weary of these defects and I hope that my review helps out, I mean for a 60-80 bucks figures. Tis is a problem. So I gave this action figure a 2 out of 5 star"
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"Unbelievable! This was such a rare car, and I thought it would be cool. But no, soon after I bought it, the tow cable came off, and the paint on the windshield got scratched off. Not recommending this to anybody!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Love the details on Schleich animals. We keep a zoo and a farm at our house for grandchildren. They love them, and are usually the first choice when they come to our house. Excellent detail and great prices make this a keeper!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Got if for the in-law, he has fun with it, and its a good party entertainer"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I took this toy out to play with a new baby (8 weeks) who was visiting and WHOA! her eyes lit up when she saw it. I think the combination of the bright colors and contrasting patterns initially drew her attention. But, when I was able to move it around and make it talk, she was totally captivated. I think this could be a great first gift for new parents when they're trying to figure out how to interact with their baby. Being a puppet and playing the role of a character is very natural and more fun that doing flash cards!

Two notes: the look of this is very simliar to the Skip Hop character washcloths. My daughter (age 4) didn't make a distinction and this guy ended up in the bathtub one afternoon. Still great fun, but not used as intended. (He dried out just fine). Also, the fabric does seem to attract pet hair and lint, especially off the carpet. But, that also seems to wipe off without much trouble."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,Not at all what I was expecting. This was a large box of plastic pieces that don't fit together. I'm sure the only way this toy would be usable is if you glued the pieces together.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My grandson and granddaughter loved them, they keep them on the butcher's shelves and use them on a table, they work well for staying at the other grandparents too, transport well and have all they need to do their artwork at their house.  They get a lot of use but not rough use, they are holding up well so far, for my grandchildren ages six and eight."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my granddaughter  to help her learn to manipulate turning, pushing, etc.
So far, so good.  She loves the pop up!  She has the most trouble with the turning one on the right end, but is learning which is the purpose.  Very cute, a classic toy box toy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Very well made.  Nice lens and large.

Light weight also.  Tongue on the lizard/snake won't come off too easy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"To be honest, I really can't find anything wrong with this kit. The poseability is great, the balance is good, it comes with plenty of accessories (including those of the regular HG Jesta). At the end of the day, it's not my favorite design, but you really can't go wrong with this guy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,A little twist to the classical game.  Our kids love playing this over and over.  The first game to come down from the shelf when we have friends over.
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"poor quality expensive  item!

i bought this light saber for my son 7 years old.
1-the light doesn't last long
2-the saber broke in 2
3- one of the saber broke into 4 pieces.
Big piece of Sh......"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 8 year old daughter loved that I was able to buy her so many legos this year. Well, build bricks. They work perfect with her Legos. She doesn't even notice the difference and they are all now mixed with the Legos. The Lego kits are starting to become way too expensive and my daughter loves creating different things with Legos. So we will still buy different kits every once in a while. But will definitely be buying more Building Bricks for her and for when my son becomes old enough to play with legos."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I purchased 2 of these. Both my Grand Daughters enjoyed arranging & rearranging the pieces. Ordering the Nativity set also.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,Too many rollers for the dough and not enough of the other cutting and shaping toys.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I've been using these with my daughter since she was 8 months old, she is now 5. She loved them then, and loves them now. They are even great to use paint brushes with. It honestly does not matter what the paint gets on, them, clothing, carpet, table, walls, ANYTHING, it WILL come out. With a wipe. No cleaners, nothing. Adore these paints! Yet they work great on whatever they are painting :) Perfect consistency."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Two year granddaughter loves this toy! Well made. Melissa and Doug toys never disappoint.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,A dependable flyer everytime. Used for 1st Grade Science demonstration for Newton's laws
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I like it. Fits my 4' 10"" tween very well. Long gloves do not stay up on her forearms, but ok, not a major issue.  She's happy = I'm happy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My daughter loces this toy. She even uses it as a night light at night.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,A great sculpt for an action figure and joy for the kids. One always needs some suoper villains for the superheroes to wage battle with.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 8 year old absolutely loves this watch! It not only takes pictures, but has little games on it too. He loved the flame wrist band the most."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Love this toy! It's great for attaching to things like the stroller bar on our stroller! I love it's portability and that it easily attaches to things because of the coil like shape!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,well made and fits 18 in Madame Alexander doll beautifully
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I really like the games by this company (Gamewright). They have a whole series of short easy to play games and this is one of them. My four year old has been able to play this because it is easy and short and is over before his attention span is over. My eight year old has enjoyed this game and others like it by this company.

I'm not sure how educational it is, but I will say that it does help younger children with visual discrimination which is a prereading skill. Because this is a card game it is somewhat prone to being destroyed by young hands. However, the cards are larger than normal playing cards and very sturdy.

I would not hesitate to buy this game again. Enjoy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Very cute. Maybe not 100% the quality I wouldve liked, but perfectly acceptable for the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We used these to make vampire donuts, using plain glazed donuts from the grocery store, and used skittles as the eyes. These did work, but the hinge portion on some was too thick and they popped open a bit, on a few of them. Poor QA/QC there, I think!

We solved that by closing/folding them closed first and pressing hard with a metal serving spoon and creasing and reinforcing that folded hinge area, and then placing them in the donuts. It worked great!

We scattered them on tables, in among bags of pretzels and wrapped candy, and also placed these in big glass jars with spooky printed labels we stuck on the fronts. They're small, so only the kids could really wear them comfortably, but they worked great for our purposes."

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the flashing rings, the seller or with amazon, except for as a customer."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Here's a toddler-friendly, math-friendly, gender-neutral (the girl is driving, right?)R/C car that's sweet and cute, too, as opposed to oozing, slithering or decked in camo.  My 3-year-old nephew got a kick out of manning the controls, and the dexterity and spatial awareness that come with maneuvering the car are not bad payoffs.  Do you need a toy to teach you how to count to ten and back?  I don't think so.  This is more about making something go.  There is a window of time when kids think R/C is magical, and this will appeal to a boy or a girl."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,We greatly enjoy putting this puzzle together. My daughter always asks what comes next. So then we sing the alphabet song.  Each puzzle piece is pretty big and they are easy to put together.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Nephew is a big Kirby fan and loved this.  This plush has held up well as my nephew is only 7 years old.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,The pieces are the perfect size for my granddaughters and are easy to clean.  We've had quite a few tea parties over the past 2 days! They love it...
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Your fossil lover will have tons of fun with this! Takes a lot of patience though! My 4 year old was a little impatient.
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?

Also, I noticed Learning Resources commented on another review recently, stating that the only updates they made to the board were artistic. That is patently false and is the difference between a one and five star game/review for me."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,We bought this for our game room! It looks great and even our 4 year old can get in on the fun! Very happy with purchase.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"These trains arrived promptly all in a tiny see thru plastic zip top bag. They are slightly larger than the trains that came with my Mexican train domino set, but just barely. I purchased these when my teenager lost 6 of the 8 trains we had and we had only played a handful of times. I waited for months hoping the trains would show up. Low and behold within days of buying these trains she found the lost trains. Figures, right?

Now we have a lovely selection of the solid colored trains that came with our game and several more to choose from!  Solid, clear colored ones and some with glitter, something to appeal to everyone. I didn't think the train colors were ugly at all as some reviewers said. And if you should get an ""ugly"" color in your batch just think of it like the most unplayed token in Monopoly, it's really not the end of the world. They are sturdy little trains and are very similar to the ones that came with our game, no complaints here. *would like to include a picture but on my mobile I'm unable to do so,  I'll try again soon."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I love these dot markers! My 3 year old daughter likes to dot and drag rather than simply dot. Other brands of dot markers were easily ruined and now leak heavily when used. I'm not worried about these because the tip appears to be cloth rather than foam. The colors are also very vibrant and you get 8 markers rather than the usual 6 pack offered by other brands. Very happy with this purchase!
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,Smaller than I thought but arrived in a timely manner.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"So my daughter gets this and immediately goes nuts over it.  She loves to mix stuff up from her Build A Bear outfits to her old easy bake oven.

She brings it to her latest slumber party and of course, six 10 year old girls go gaga.

Pros:
Easy to open
Makes ""signature scents"" as quoted by my daughter.
The scents don't last which sounds like a con but half a dozen girls all smelling like a flower shop tends to mess up the allergies.
I read the directions.  It was a snap to combine.

Cons:
A bit expensive--you don't get a lot but what you get is fun to combine."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Is good the figure,but delivered a scratch and not nice inside the box for packing?"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,As others stated it will tip easily but my 3yr old still loved it and I wouldn't abandon him in it anyways.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,These are great.  Our granddaughter uses them whenever she's here.  Wipes clean with a damp cloth too.  In case there are any misses.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,these were my grandson he is 7 and had to have them
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Our 15 yr. old son got the Dawn of the Xyz for his 8 yr. little sister who is 8. She believes it's perfect for anyone who wants to start playing the game.

The box comes with a beginner pamphlet which is easy to comprehend and uses the cards in the deck as examples.  The deck itself is very well balanced and it consist mostly of weaker, warrior type monsters which can be used to summon XYZ monsters.  It also has great cards like Mirror Force and  Gene-Warped Warwolf, a level 4 normal monster with 2000 atk points. The true power of this deck however comes from the three included XYZ monsters.

The deck is easy to use, and constabulary strong considering it is for beginners and encourages adding cards to personalize the deck to your own preference. Overall, this deck is good for beginners, or experienced players who want strong cards."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The boys love it. It is a challenge to build, but really cool to play with. A great Christmas present for that active boy who loves to build and figure things out. The components seem to be well made. The test of time will determine actual durability. I will re-post if I notice issues with durability. For now, it is great though."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This little guy is a great addition to my Star Wars Funko Pop collection
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Super cute dolls however the arms/hands come off rather easy.  They are supposed to, as in Monster High School doll style, but these are way too easy to pull off.  We lost an arm within an hour of play."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This hay hook is awesome. I had never used one in all my life, but by using one I can jam it in and drag it across the floor without any work at all.  On top of it, you can twist the string with it and it snaps; so overall feeding the livestock has become a super cinch compared to what I was doing before!  Super high quality too, and the bright red color makes it impossible to lose in the hay bales!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,These crafts are so much fun for children.  Everything is prepackaged for each individual craft and easy to use.

The lights and sounds are awesome!
It looks like a real fire truck in action but in a toy version, very cool. When you turn it on, it lights up and makes noises and then starts going around the room, moving when it bumps into things, and then after a few seconds, it stops and lifts up and just starts spinning while raising the ladder on its own. I have had some problems with my trucks that we've gotten that are like this where they just don't last after a couple times but this one is holding up great and just seems to be built better."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"I will start this by saying that my son looked awesome in this costume and the outfit itself is really great.  He got so many compliments, mostly from dads.  I think people appreciate seeing a kid dressed up as a normal person rather than a TV character or something.

The problem with this costume was with the cap:  it was misshapen and hard to keep on his head.  I tried to contact the company to get a replacement for the cap but had no luck.  I would have had to return to Amazon.  I bought too close to Halloween and the rest of the costume was so cute, we just kept it and he still looked great."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We bought this for our 15 month old niece for Christmas, and per her mom, she's loving it!  When we saw it at the store, it was really cute in design.  The sounds were not too annoying, and it really seemed to do a lot of different functions.  Kudos to LeapFrog for another cute and educational toy!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Funko POP figures have become my latest addiction!  Robocop is a must since I'm a man of the 80's.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I gave this for a Christmas present and my grandson has really enjoyed toting his toy tractors and animals around in it.  It is very convenient for travel.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these Chalk Markers.

I use these to make pictures on the widows for my kids. They love waking up to see what scene I have made on the living room window using my chalk marker. I have a pack of colors, and this pack of white made it perfect for making a winter scene. The white is so vibrant.

When I am done, the chalk wipes up really easily with my microfiber cloth.

I also use these on my chalk labels int he kitchen and I love them."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Can get them at the local dollar store for less.  I could not tell a difference in  the quality.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"We have fun with this game--but the holes the objects are placed into seem to be bigger than in the set I had as a kid, so it's not as challenging. My kid gets bored a lot faster than I used to."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,I got this just for the minifigures. The Tree and extra stuff is nice but a lot of these minifigs aren't in any other set.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Bought this for my son's fifth birthday at a local toy store. They had a demo model in the store so I bought it full aware that the black foam edging isn't going to last based on the condition of the demo one and from reading reviews.  However, we are trying to be gentle with it. My son and I like to play bowling with it as well as air hockey. We have soft, stuffed bowling pins and just use them as the pushers and the soccer disc as the puck down our hallway. My son also enjoys spinning it around and watching the lights in motion. Even my 2 1/2 year old enjoys kicking it. It is a tad bit noisy on our tile floor but I wouldn't say it is too bothersome."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,8 month old granddaughter really loved it and still plays with it a year later.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We had a similar one for my daughter, but couldn't find it and wanted to take my son in the pool! He loves it! The monster in front as well as the attached toys are great for keeping him occupied, and the top is great for shade! Love this!"
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"These were fine.  100 pieces sounded like a lot, but in reality there weren't very many. They are tiny little chips."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Though as others have mentioned, it doesn't really seem a deluxe edition. I have made mine a Deluxe edition by adding the wooden insert with token tray, sold by ""Broken Token"", added 4 extra pairs of dice, and sleeved all the cards. I used Standard Clear Magic the gathering type sleeves for the starter cards and light blue yu-gi-oh sized sleeves for the rest. The cards are not warping when sleeved. My 35.00 investment is now a 72,00 investment with my upgrades, but it is a nice game for 2-5 players."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Birthday Gift for my Pre-teen Grandson.  He tells me he loves it.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I've had the giggle gang app on my tablet for awhile now, and it's one of my son's favorite things. I decided to buy this and then pop it out from behind the tablet the net time he played with it, and he flipped! It goes everywhere with him. He is 18 months and adores this toy above all others... And thankfully for me, I can switch off the toy before he goes to bed with it."

She always wants to play with them. When you don't let her she is pretty upset lol! I would give it 5 stars but the bag broke as soon as I unzipped it to let her play with them on Christmas. I had to replace it with another bag to put them in. It was a pretty bag too. I would definitely recommend these for a young child. They cant really swallow them and you won't be scared letting them put it in their mouths because the blocks are huge."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I got this on a lighting deal.  The plates come front to front, back to back, so you do not have worry about un-sticking them.  The size is not huge, so you can build rooms and still move the characters around.  The pillars can be used as walls, but it would use of many for a single room.  I  plan to keep an eye out for the next lighting deal on these.  They can be used as display stands or as buildings.  I have used them as holders for loos bricks so they do not roll of the table."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I have purchased a total of 4 of these Whipple sets.  My son and 2 older daughters each got one and absolutely loved making these creations.  They had so much fun with it that we bought one for their cousin for her birthday, too.  I've got an adorable little pie keychain now to show for it!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"As described, but keep in mind the walls collapse for safety. Do not use as a play pen."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"7 yo twin girls , totally Barbie.. love them and the color changing options.  A hit, all I can say!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Very cute little dresses. My daughter is going to love these when she'll open them up on her birthday in one month. They are well stitched so I am impressed.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased these magnets to go along with a magnet board I made for my son's 2nd birthday gift. They're made of relatively thick foam with the entire back side covered with a magnet. My son got ahold of the train and gnawed on it for a good 5 minutes before we noticed. The picture I attached shows a brand new pig and the train post-chew session. Even after his pit bull like gnawing, the train still looks pretty good, although you can see the indentations from his teeth. I like the variety of objects included as it'll help in expanding his everyday vocabulary."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,bought these for my daughters Minnie Mouse bday party. They were very cute and perfect for hot beverages.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Awesome Easter gift for our 9 year old daughter.  We looked in the stores but the prices varied or they were out of stock.  This is the playdoh we grew up with, and a cute way for today's generation to enjoy playing with it."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My five year old daughter enjoyed this Barbie. She was able to apply the glitter to the hair with a little help from her older sister. The hair design/glitter activity seems to be kind of a one off thing in my opinion. After doing the hair once, she quickly discarded the accompanying glitter, stickers, etc; and just played with the doll. On the plus side, she LOVES the doll especially the accessories this Barbie comes with."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This was a big hit at Easter.  Better than candy...well it is.
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"NOTE: The one star is for the company selling the item, not the product.  I won't know this product at this price.

I know it happens every year, and we all have the option to just not purchase the item.  But, just this morning this item was available for $30 here and at Target, but I needed to get to work.  Lesson learned on that.  Now apparently those items are all sold out, so here it is at over twice the ""worth"" of the item.  It's too bad."

The build quality is good, but it is made entirely of lightweight plastic.  It is mostly correct, except the poseable arms are a little off. They do not retract inside the robot and instead stick out. It's not a big deal. The robot is about 10"" tall, but you can raise the head to make it about 11"".

The robot includes 3 cheap AAA trial batteries. I immediately replaced them with Alkalines. They are accessed from the bottom of the robot, and a screwdriver is required.  The power switch is also on the bottom. Options are: Off, Play, and Trial. Dialogue is triggered by pushing the robot's power pack on the side. Push it once, and it says one the robot's popular phrases. Hold the button for a few seconds, and it will go thru all the robot's dialogue. If I counted correctly, there are 15 phrases.  The LED lights look very cool.

All around, I like this little robot. Is it a little overpriced?  Perhaps. It still looks cool on my desk though."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I didn't love it but my Granddaughter does.  Lego, forever the best toys!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"These work well although I find the wire to insulation ratio a bit disproportionate.

Im glad they come in a 10 pack :)"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Both were able to pickup the rules quickly at the age of 6. I enjoyed playing so much that I purchased the wooden gobblet game. This us obviously geared towards children and has less pieces.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,grandson has had a great time taking hikes and using all his new backyard safari stuff
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"They didn't work.  Sent back for a full refund.  We could see ourselves in the screen, but no sound, and couldn't see the other person.  Super disappointing on Christmas morning."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,the cherry cruiser is nice edition for the townhouse and the critters. i loved it and my little niece.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"I ordered this item assuming it was the Real Bananagrams. I was sent a cheaper ""take-off"" of the real Bananagrams game. There was no trademark for the game on the storage bag - which the original version of the game has. I compared the true Bananagrams at a local toy store and the version I was sold here was a cheaper take-off on the real product. The storage bag was cheap, thin material with lose threads. The true version of this game has a nice quality storage bag with the trademark on the bag.

The instructions actually had words that were spelled incorrectly - funny as this game is about spelling.

Just beware you might receive a cheaper ""take-off"" version of this game when ordering from this supplier.

Disappointing and also dishonnest to sell it this way."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,A happy customer in Hawaii!  I bought these for my son's preschool for their science table.  The kids really enjoyed it.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"These are good enough, however, there is not a red.  For 50 colors you would think a red would be included.  Most colors are pastel in nature."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We are a gaming family so I try to add quality games to our assortment of choices to pick through. The quality of the components in this game are excellent quality as is the very large game board. The concept is easy and not over complicated and doesn't need to be. The game play is exceptional and our seven year old daughter says it is now her favorite game (beating out a few versions of RISK no less). While this edition is not cheap, we do not regret spending the extra money one bit. The tins for the cars are nice as well.

I am sure we will get years of enjoyment out of this game and we could not be happier with our purchase."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Back and better than ever!!! I had both Shrinky Dinks and TMNT Toys as a kid and it's so cool that everything is back for the new generation. What's even better now is that the plastic is pre-cut so there's no sharp plastic edges like before. It's little things like that which make a big difference. So does the play set. Wow! It's a 3d backdrop to play with the creations on. There's all the turtles and villains too.

The kit includes the pencils and everything needed to color, create, and play. You just need your own oven and baking sheet. Adult supervision is needed on this one but they can color on their own. It's more fun than coloring in coloring books... so much fun to create you'll want to do it with the kids, especially if you are sentimental for Shrinky Dinks of the 70's-80's.

If you're not familiar with Shrinky Dinks, once baked the little flexible flat plastic sheets shrink, harden, and thicken to become permanent hard plastic play pieces. You can even poke a hole before baking and hang them on a necklace."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"With the soft sounds and colors, this toy is a superb companion for any toddler and introduce him/her to the subtleties of music. Our 15 months old liked this toy but it is a bit early for him to get engaged with it. It seems to be more suitable for an 18 months old as recommended by the manufacturer or even older toddlers who gain basic understanding of cause and effect and the rhythms in the sound.

I wish the string was longer than mere 9"". The center of the wooden handle with string is about 12"" long in total. That is too short even for average height toddler. Kids do not pull toys with hands stretched all the way down. Most of the time he pulls the string at chest level which renders the toy hanging in air instead of being a pull toy.

It is very good for a sit down play and can engage a toddler if he gets interested in music. Otherwise, as a pull toy it may not work successfully. With the current price range, I would expect that the designers in the company must have thought through this aspect.

Overall build quality if very good and sturdy and I have no doubts about the longevity of the toy when subjected to normal toddler type abuse."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Purchased for a seven year old for Halloween 2016. He has tried it on and it fits him great, sized exactly right. He cannot wait to wear it. Seems put together well; the boots have a little Velcro strap to try and keep them down around the shoe. The outfit was easy for him to put on; the cape comes off for easy changing and he had a little wiggle room so he can wear some long underwear or thermals under it when we go out trick-or-treating. The mask fits perfect as well; there are little cushions in the mask so the plastic isn't right on his face. So far, very good buy; cheap and fits him perfectly."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Very soft and pliable but smaller than realized. Curled up it fits in hand. Really soft and not hard plastic so was pleased with that and detail was nice.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 18 month old grandson loves this toy as do his two older sisters. They all love music, singing and dancing, and this toy has given them hours of pleasure as they listen and sing along to some of their favorites like ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes."" Plus included in the box are the lyrics to the songs just in case, as an adult, you don't know them! You'll be singing ""If You're Happy and You Know it"" with embarrassing frequency as it tends to stay in your head just like when the song came out!

The kids are able to record their own songs as well as sing to the five included prerecorded ones. The mirror is fun for the baby to laugh and giggle at himself as he watches the girls dance around the room singing in the microphone.

A plus for parents or adults is that the toy is easy to put together! The four legs snap into the base and are held there with a screw. No complicated diagrams or instructions.

If your child loves music, this is a great durable toy that can provide hours of fun and will hold up under toddler play!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,It was a present and the recipients like it. Will recommend to other people
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"To begin with, my grandsons, ages 4 and 6, had already been watching the show and really liked it, so they were more than delighted to get their own Chuggington to play with. The thing I like about this toy is its sturdiness.  If it's one thing I've learned about little boys it's that they are rough on toys, yet they get upset if something breaks.  I sympathize with the person who said the cars fall off the tracks, but my experience has been that unless you pay a lot of money and buy replicas of real trains and anchor the tracks down permanently somewhere, you will have that problem with any toy that runs on tracks.  Also, the set is chunky enough and easy enough to set up to not frustrate small children whose fine motor skills are not that well developed.  Therefore, the toy helps give children confidence that they can do something themselves.  And I think that any toy that lets children use their own imagination when they play is very good.  There are far too many toys out there that don't do that.  Everything is already imagined for the child.  Not only are these toys not helping children, they are downright boring to play with.  I don't believe that most people realize how important it is for children to develop their imaginations.  This is not something frivilous.  It is those who can imaginine new technology, new inventions, and new and better ways of living that bring progress to the world."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,Pretty dice but not what I expected based on the picture provided by Amazon. I should have read the reviews but I pulled the trigger based on the image alone. They are nice and sparkly. Reminds me of the unicorn fad but just not what I was looking for. Chessex please update your dice listings with descriptions of the colors and more images!
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Very cute, the girls loved them but they are very small."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Both my kids loved these toys (we had two over the course of  years) as babies. We dragged them everywhere, used them as rattles, teethers, comfort toys. I always buy it for my friends who are to become parents for the first time."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,It was a bit stiffer than I expected but my 3 year old is happy with it!
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Its nice, but feels very flimsy, like it can snap with to much pressure or if accidentally stepped on. Still fun."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Adorable costume for my little buccaneer. She loved it for Halloween and looked super cute. Great price too.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Originally payed close to $20 , so its somewhat disappointing to see how much the price fell considering its a larger Pop. Good for anyone planning to buy today. Still an awesome buy to complete the Guardians set."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I love how it comes with the handle and wheels to cart around behind my son.  The only thing that I did not like was that it comes apart very easily and my 2 year old is constantly pulling the front and back apart.  But it is durable, and he has yet to break it.
For the price it is a great deal if you have a little boy who loves his cars and trucks like mine."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Once my daughter saw this at her 3rd birthday, she was not interested in anything else. This helps teach fine motor skills and my daughter caught on right away. She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she wants to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,These are just great!!  Better then any other bands I have got for my kids.  They last ling and the colors are so bright I am very happy!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,A fun way for a child to learn to dress himself.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Works as is supposed to. Talking is clear. Child loves it.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Fun!!  We had a blast playing with this in the pool.  We used water guns to see who could spray it to the other side first & we played volleyball with it too.  It's pretty big, we thought the wind might take it out of the pool but it didn't.  This was a big hit with the kids & the adults!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,great for my daughters AG doll. she loves them because her doll has the same glasses and case as her pappou
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"the quality id good, price is right and they can come right to your door,so you don't have to drive all over town looking for them-kids love them and they can take what kids dish out in play time"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This is not my first Barbie Dream House.  In fact, I own this exact same one from about 3 years ago.  The design is the same, but the colors are brighter and the pictures have changed a bit to reflect the movies.

The unit shipped with two parts broken that will require them to replace the entire unit.  We'll see how they handle that and I'll update my review.  It is also missing two pieces.  And when I looked back at my old dreamhouse I found that two things that were broken on this one were broken on that one two and I just never noticed that they were supposed to light up (the fridge light and the fireplace light).

The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.

The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.

The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.

For fun I would give this product many stars.  The kids enjoy playing with it. It is big, pink, has Barbie and fits Barbie sized dolls.  I would recommend this overall but know that it is not quite as sturdy as it can be."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Play-doh equipment has always looked super fun on the shelf at the store.  However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

Things that could be improved, ideally there would be a way or a tool to make the correct shaped log, or a way to just stuff play-doh in and it still work without jamming up."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,This is a really neat product made of good quality as are all the Melissa and Doug products I have purchased
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"She is small and soft with a lot of curly hair.  Easy to carry, comfortable to hold.  Her hair is a very curly synthetic that isn't going to last long since our grand daughter has an urge to brush it.  It's cute enough, but not practically functional."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this because my son was given a similar track system made by a competitor and loved it for the short time it functioned (hand-me-down gift).  However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen. So that annoys me, but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son didn't stop smiling...My 9-year-old god son likes it, as well!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"If you can believe it, Spirograph actually works better now than the old version from decades ago when I was a kid. Great price, the kids love it."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"These are cute, but very small. The pictures make them seem large and even though I checked the measurements, they still seemed small. Some of the drawstrings are not stitched correctly so they are fraying. Plus my order was missing a few bags. But they worked as party favor holders, which is what I wanted them for."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this doll for my 16 month old daughter who showed interest in giving her pacifier to another doll, so I figured we'd try this one out.  She seems to like 'feeding' the baby and watching her go to 'sleep' and we both like the fact that this doll has a feature that closes/opens the eyes depending on which way the bottle is 'fed'.  So far this doll has been a hit; it's soft body is fun to cuddle and carry, the eyes are cute and it's a good size, not too bulky.  We give this one an A+++"
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"I bought three of these previously (black, green & blue), and they were all 10"" long x 6"" tall, as described. Not this one. This one is 1. 25"" shorter in length (from back of handle to end of barrel) and almost an inch shorter in height! So is the pink one above it in the picture. The black one on top is only 8"" long and 4."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Cheap and easy fun. The item is well designed and while not designed for a LOT of battles, it's a fun toy.

The sound card is EXTREMELY LOUD with the sounds you want for a Light Saber battle.

Our Fix? The hilt comes apart with screws. We inserted crafting felt into the speaker at the bottom of the hilt. Once put back together, the sound is audible but not deafening. Perfect for our kids to play with."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I liked the lalaloopsy because it was a good part of my collection.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,it was fun when i got it after a week or 2 it wasn't fun anymore.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 4 year old Granddaughter really loved making me a necklace with this wooden bead set, as it is well made and easy to thread the beads onto the string."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a fun craft kit for girls. The set makes a star shaped decor item whose frame snaps together. This frame is then decorated with the included string as well as little beads and gems that come in the kit. It's a fun kit but it's the all that difficult or involved. An eight year old could easily complete the project without assistance and older girls, over twelve or so, will likely become bored with it or complete the project very quickly. What I like most about the kit is that it doesn't involve glue or anything messy. It's something that can be completed on a car trip."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I bought this Webkinz for my granddaughter for her 11th birthday. She love it!  Very cuddley and soft. Monty Moose is very well made. My order was shipped promptly and arrived as promised and in excellent condition. I bought her 3 Webkinz at the same time. I wrapped each one individually and gave her one each day leading up to her birthday.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 2 year old daughter and 5 year old nieces absolutely love this toy! The playset comes with a pretty Cinderella figure, the carriage that has molds built into it, and 3 jars of Playdoh. We love that the carriage has molds you can press the Playdoh into to make the fairy god mother, her dress skirt, Jaq, Gus, birds, and a pumpkin. The Playdoh presses easily into them and comes out easily as well without ruining the mold you just made and it's easy to peel away the excess Playdoh around it. Her favorite is that the wheels of the carriage have brick imprints and Cinderella's slipper to make a stunning walkway for Cinderella to walk on. The top of the carriage is really neat that you can press it down and make pumpkin vines. The carriage itself is gorgeous and colorful and doubles as a working rolling carriage for Cinderella to ride in as well as for making the molds.

The plastic carriage is thickly made and very durable to handle even rough play from younger kids. My daughter also likes to reenact the story with the molded figures and so it can be used for dramatic play as well. She also uses her other Disney Princess figurines to interact with Cinderella, though we don't put Playdoh on them. I love the creativity and old school fun this toy offers without any ritzy technology like most toys these days.

The only downside to this toy is that it's hard to clean the Playdoh out of the vine press, but that's to be expected. It would've been nice to have a cutting tool included too. Overall, this is a big hit in our house and well worth the price, plus you can buy more Playdoh colors to go with this!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Hours of fun and make-believe. He watches the movie on the couch with all his cars lined up.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 10 year old loves this. He's becoming quite the master. Crashed quite a few times, nothing broken so far. I would say it's a great beginner."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter. Came in a box and looks to be of good quality. I like toys like this that are a project for kids and become a keepsake as well.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Really cute.  Great purchase.  Sure to be a hit at July party.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,Only two bracelets have anything Disney on them.  However my daughter still loves them to wear them all the time!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This baby bottle makes cute little crying and giggling sounds. Its a little bit bigger than the usual doll's baby bottle.. Which is good, so its not so easy to lose. "
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Anyone who loves the Minions, will love this theme based play set.  Cute little figures.  Comes with its own case.  Not recommended for smaller kids based on the size of the characters"
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Nice way for my daughter to practice applying makeup. Make goes on paper pretty good, better than I thought. She enjoys it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I remember the 12 inch Indiana Jones doll back in 1981 that was out for about a week, it seemed anyway. It was imposable to find then and I have been waiting for it for years! (Because I wouldn't pay the ridiculous price for it as time went by).
Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down. Does anyone at Hasbro have the slightest clue how useless this feature is? It's a minor nuisance and overall it's worth owning though other companies are now making much better detailed versions of Indiana Jones in 12"" form."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a very cute lego. I got him to go with a LOTRs set. He goes well with the set. I tried to put the cape over his arms, but my husband figured out it goes over his neck, before his head goes on. The little hands rotate, making him very easy to pose. He should hold up to years of playtime."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Loved this pinata. It was perfect. Came on time and worked as suggested. Would definitely buy again.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I would actually give mine a glowing review had it not been for one stiff wrist joint, hand broke off leaving the peg in the slot. His ankles were fine and his paint job was good, so I'm all the more annoyed at myself (I even thought ""Gee, it would suck if I broke the wrist and got the peg stuck in the slot ...""). Aesthetically speaking, it's quite good, though they over did it a bit with the top-heavy look, true, they were pretty barrel chested with tiny legs on the show, but this is just slightly more exaggerated, it's not a deal breaker at all though. While articulated enough to get a fairly wide range of poses, it's still hampered a bit because the range of the joints is limited a bit by the bulk of the figure, only to a small degree however. The only real ""flaw"" I felt there was with it in its own right was the lack of a swivel joint at the hips (a two way ankle join would also have fixed this). The stand is a bit of a joke, though it serves its purpose. Due to the width of his waist it doesn't actually hold him, but it works enough to prop him up with the cape draping over it.

Oh, he also comes with optional capes, couldn't for the life of me figure out how to switch them. Finally, when I broke the wrist I stopped caring and yoinked the head off (I was afraid before there was some other trick ad pulling the head off was requiring no small amount of effort, so ""I didn't want to break it""), that is definitely how it's meant to be done, it's a thick rubber-y plastic on a ball and socket joint (though you only get left/right movement), so I hope that clears up some head scratching."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Got it for my 6 year old grandson. He loved it and wants to wear it all the time. Very realistic looking.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Fast shipping. Deck was sealed.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My son loves this! The older he gets, the more he enjoys it. He ate the sticker off of the front. Wish this had been colored plastic instead because now the large button is just white. Doesn't seem to bother him though!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I chose this one over more expensive ones intended for physicians because so many people loved it for their hobbies.  I figure MD stands for ""someone to Make Dough off of"" so prices are generally marked up.  I bought a $10 black light from a Halloween supply website and can easily remove lost contact lenses or foreign bodies."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"My 19 month old son loves to vacuum.  So I decided to purchase a vacuum just his size.  The only problem we've had with it, is the red bottom is stuck and I can't get it to shut off!!!  I had to take the batteries out of it.  He still plays with it, but not as much.  It is a lot smaller then I thought.  I think it could have come with Batteries!!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This is super cute and I love the little birds. I just wish there were more of them.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"it must just be kids. My son loved it for two days...its funny how kids give you a really good guilt trip to get them something then after you get them the thing they want the most, then find out in less than the time it takes to deliver it, they lose interested."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My 5 and 2 year old grandsons love this game. It is something different from other games that have either a path or playing cards. The only problem is the spinner. When the boys hold it, the arrow catches on a finger."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Bought these for our LO and he likes them so far. We will see when he's a bit older (7mo). They suck up water & you squirt the kid for endless laughs.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection. If you're a fan of the show, character, or just love collecting figures, get this, it's a solid purchase!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Pleased with purchase ...daughter was happy with it likes to collect these
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"I'm only giving 2 stars because of how annoying this toy gets. It's so loud and there is no on off or lower volume setting. As soon as the battery is in if the trigger is pulled it goes off extremely loudly. It's a good product maybe for a child old enough to play outside on there own but for my toddler the fact I could not turn it off or adjust the volume made this toy a hell on earth for me. However it does work well and lights up and blasts loudly for the price so if you don't mind the fact it's never ending, then go for it!!!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I really like this doll.  Her stilts make her fun and interesting and her hair came out looking great - sometimes the curly haired ones end up messy and all over the place.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"i really, really like this cube. it turns pretty well. obviously, the best part about this cube is the hole in the middle of it. it definitely comes in handy when i'm trying to hold it and have other things in my hand at the same time because i can put the cube on my finger and make room for other things in my hand. the best way i found to solve this cube is this: R', D', R, D. Please Note: in order for this algorithm to work, the cube Must, Must, Must start in its solved state. otherwise, it won't work. however, if you start with it solved, you will need to do R', D', R, D  a total of 6 times and the cube will be solved again."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My one year-old son totally loves his other Oball trucks, but I admit that I was a little unsure about this one -- I really didn't think that he would figure out how it works, and I wasn't sure that it would be as ""fun"" as a dump truck or bulldozer. Well, I unpacked it from the frustrating packaging one night and left it on the floor, and the next morning he found it while I was making breakfast. By the time I came over to see what he was doing, he was opening the sides up and taking he cars out, stacking other things in there, closing it up again, and running the truck around. There's even a little ramp that comes down the back for the cars to come down from.

The only downside for me on this one is that the design seems a little more finicky than most toys we use at this age. When you're closing either one of the sides of the carrier or the ramp, their are bits on either end of it that need to snap in. To get both, you either need to realize that you need to push in on both edges of the ramp and on both ends of the each of the flap down sides, or you need to apply pressure pretty exactly in the middle -- so with a young child, it's super common for just one end to snap in and the other end to still be unlatched, which in this house sometimes means that the doors flop back open when you hit a bump. It's not the end of the world, and I'm sure he'll figure it out as he gets a bit older -- but it's occasionally frustrating for him now."
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"Unimpressive. I thought ""racers"" would move a little better b"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Very cool puppet. Well made and fairly realistic. Easy to manipulate for children.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"We got this for our 2 and a half year old for Christmas, who loves trains. Yes, he loves the train but the coupling is very weak and loose and does not hold together well.  Also, for the price, there are very few train parts, and a lot of superfluous plain old dup.os.  Also, this item does not come with a track, although from the looks on the box, you might think so.  Another thing is that the figures that come with it are larger than other duplo sets, so they will not fit in other duplo vehicles, and the train roof will not close if they are inside. Not so much for the price. I would buy the circus train that duplo sells much cheaper."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"If you've got a kid who is building cars in the garage they might be okay putting this together, but I'm thinking it's more for adults, both because the game Destiny is not a kid's game, and because there are some very small parts and somewhat complex instructions. At any rate, I would recommend the builder be at least 10-12 years old depending on skill level.

My wife got this and was overjoyed to begin putting it together. She found the instructions a bit frustrating at times, but had it put together in a few days with no help from me, and she's never really done anything like this before so she was surprised that she took to it so well (she really just wanted the finished product but seemed to get really into the building process from my perspective).

There are extra parts that come with the model, and the finished product is mighty cool (though a bit subdued in color, but that's Destiny for you). When you are done you'll have a nice block model to display but I wouldn't recommend ""playing with it"" unless you want to see fragile broken pieces all over your house.

Recommended for Destiny fans who are also builders with moderate skill and enjoy assembling models. Worth the price if building models like this is your thing."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Cute stickers of Pusheen, but wished the stickers were a little larger in size. But they are cute still and like them."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We have and enjoy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Radio-Flyer-All-Terrain-Wagon/dp/B00004YT13/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Radio Flyer All Terrain Wagon</a>, and were pleased to discover that this wagon is a bit more sturdy (although not by a wide margin).  We loved the pneumatic tires on the Radio Flyer, and these are just as nice.  The raised sides on this wagon are more reassuring for keeping kids from tumbling out while hauling around corners or bumping over dirt walking trails.  The plastic handle is comfortably large for even the most generously sized hands.  This wagon feels like it will last a lifetime."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"MagWorld tiles are fun for kids, and they inspire imaginative play.  My 4-year-old daughter loves to play with these.  There is a good variety of shapes and sizes, and this 60-piece set is a nice size.  I think if you had a smaller set, it would be difficult to build much, but 60 is enough.  The reason I am giving these four stars instead of five is that these tiles are clearly not as ""sticky"" as MagnaTiles, which are also significantly pricier.  These tiles do not stick together as well because the tiles are thicker, which has the effect of making the magnets seem weaker.  There may be an added safety benefit in that these tiles are more difficult to break, but the extra ""stickiness"" of MagnaTiles is appreciated by my daughter."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"The picture appears to be a good quality custume, when unfortunately it's not as pictured and selling for less at walmart."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"My son is finally old enough to play board games and really enjoys playing them - this mama's dream come true.  I am so looking forward to sharing all of my favorites with him.  Beware though that this is not your Sorry.  This game was fun if you are not expecting to plat the game you loved as a child.  The fire and ice ""coins"" are confusing.  You have to read the directions a few times and then play it how you find easiest (they are confusing).  I will have to find an original version of this game, but it's okay as an alternative."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I got this for my granddaughter for her birthday this summer and she really enjoys it. She started taking pictures immediately. She just turned 3 but is already getting the hang of using it. It is simple to use and also withstands being dropped. Great product.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Fun family-friendly game, even for those of us who find sushi disgusting.  A little repetitive, and I can't help but complain about there being no easy way to keep track of score."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,christmas gift so i took it out of the box to charge it up ( no waiting after opened ) & tried it out after the proper charging time & loved it. I'm sure my nephew will too.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Bruder trucks and cars are the BEST toy vehicles on the market for young boys.  My 4 year old grandson has been playing with Bruder trucks for several years and still loves them.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"For the price, this is a good deal. It's a very small box. Probably the size of a mini puzzle box. Definitely not worth the 16.00 it's listed for right now. I paid $8.00 for it and that's a decent price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My daughter loves this. She uses it like a purse and can put it over her shoulder not just carry it with a handle. I like that she has a place to put all the loose poniville ponies and accessories that go with the houses. It came with one pony which is an added bonus for the price.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I bought these for my little one year old granddaughter who love them and so does her 3 year old brother. They are so cute and so well made. They truly are great quality.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,These have worked well for my 2 year old. I love the button on the side of the headphones  - it mutes the volume so I can tell her something if I need to. We took this on an airplane and don't have any complaints to date. The volume seemed to be loud enough to hear.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,PRECIOUS!  Well made and great price.  My daughter loved it!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Adorable!!! Well made!!! I would reccomend this for any Daniel tiger loving kids.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Good quality, great colors.  Very pleased with this puzzle.  It is just the right level of difficulty and fun together"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Smaller than I expected, but still beautiful. Given to a WI native who loves the game, and has never upgraded his board or pegs. With his large hands, these are easier to grab at the top."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"CCS looks just like how she is in the anime. The box she was in, is very beautifully designed and I love it as well."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,I bought these for my two girls. These earrings were more like flat stickers not the puffy kind you sometimes see. I cut them for the Christmas advent calendar instead of candy this year. They didn't even stay on ears for 5 minutes before falling off. Girls were disappointed and so was I after I paid for these.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this cubic rube for my husband, that's his new hobby. And he said it works really smooth. Exactly how he wanted. Doesn't brake, its have duty. He is happy with this product."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,Bought this last Christmas for my kids. My kids had a blast playing with it but it only lasted a few months.  Too bad.  It just stopped working.  When I went in to change the batteries they were eroded.  scary.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Prompt delivery, creative product. Visiting grandbaby loved it Lots to learn with this simple, well-made product. 1yo grandbaby quickly discovered color matching (eg, blue ball into blue circle) and enjoyed the tap-tap PLINK as the balls went through the top hole, landed and rolled down the xylophone and back out to the carpet."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Adorable toy. Fun and entertaining for young girls. Or boys. Well made and slightly interactive. The doll has movable arms and legs. It is cute and colorful.  As cute as this is, though, I'm not sure I would want to pay the current price of $39.99 for it. I think that is way too much for this toy.

Also, the packaging was a nightmare. I understand the need to protect it during shipping, but this was a bit overkill.
My granddaughter loves it which is the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 3."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Awesome kit, simple yet fun at the same time. Absolutely love the Twin Drive system, and how it's just as posable and articulate as the figure itself. One minor nitpick is that the GN swords don't hold up nicely when placed in the hands, they are loose and will fall out when trying to pose this figure. Other than that, it's a really awesome figure, easy to put together, and overall the product is great. If you love and are a hardcore fan of Gundam, get this and add it to your collection. Highly recommend it."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"The Mega Fun 93628 Marble Fun Run has been a delight for my children to play with. This set has allowed them open ended play to build and discover for hours at a time. It's been fun watching them work and seeing them try to speed up or slow down their marbles to get to the bottom first. It's a good set to enhance problem solving skills, spatial reasoning, and so much more!

The set comes with 105 pieces and this includes 30 marbles. There are instructions to build the run on box, if so desired. The variety of pieces vary from curvy, straight, a loop de loop, starter areas with little levers, pieces that have detachable and re-attachable wheels, and more! Some of the pieces are translucent with sparkle and the rest are solid colors. The variety of colors this set is made up of makes it gender neutral. My son and daughter ages 7 and 4 years old have played with this set on their own as well as together.

This set is well made and the pieces stay together once hooked up together. I would suggest parents to put the little levers and tabs in the pieces they are meant for. My son tried to do this on his own and ended up breaking one of the pieces. With that being said, he tends to be a little rough on things. Other than that small mishap we've had no issues of the set showing wear or breaking easily.

I would certainly recommend this set. It's great for down-time during the afternoons or on days when the weather just too hot or rainy to enjoy outside. One thing I like is that more sets can be purchased to make an even bigger marble run! My kids said that they love playing with it and I am glad they do too! *I received a sample of this product for review purposes *"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"A birthday gfit for my great niece....she loved it! Good price,came fast in the mail also. She is enjoying playing with it!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My daughter loves these.  Nice color and good quality.  The carrying stick is a great addition and helps to keep the cups together. Since these were for my daughter, I know she would lose a cup at some point without it.  She is using them because they are teaching speed stacking in school.  She loved that she could take her own set of cups in for the competition."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Santa give a small one and a medium one for our 2 yo and 5 yo daughters. They love them and play with them daily. It's nice that the unicorns allow them to do some exercises everyday besides playing dolls and quiet games.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Bought 2 of these for our boys to wear on the Disney Cruise for Pirate night. I wouldnt' buy again. The top is very, very sheer & see through. My son felt uncomfortable with that and wanted to wear a shirt under it, which it didn't look good or fit properly. It is poor quality top & we actually threw it away after he wore it because it ripped. The pants are ok, and the belt is ok. You get what you pay for."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I have always loved Melissa & Doug because of their outstanding quality and educational value. When shopping for my kids I seek out the brand because its one I know I can trust.

This year is Jaxs first Christmas so its an extra special one for us. Of course Im going to go to a name I trust! At this age of almost one, he doesnt show much preference for toys. He basically likes anything and everything because he wants to explore this great big world. This is that rare time that I can get him what I want because hes not going to tell me otherwise!

The Melissa & Doug sound puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They help their growth and development with motor skills, problem solving and general thinking. Oh yeah, and they are super fun! My older kids have always liked puzzles and Jax is no different! Even though this is for 2+, he immediately started trying to put it together. He doesnt quite have the logic and reasoning to get the fit right but he sure had fun trying and big sister Paige helped him! As with all their products, the quality is good and durable. Lots of puzzles are flimsy and don't last long but these are thick wooden pieces with little red tabs for easy removal.

When you lift up or put down the piece, it makes the animal sound. I love that I can also teach Jax what sounds animals make while we do this together.

The Melissa & Doug Sound Puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They will think of it as a toy but as moms we know, they are learning!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"such a fun card game, so easy to learn, and each game lasts 15 mins.  its a lot of fun watching people play with you as you try to not get the exploding kitten card.  plus there are a lot of cute little  cards that just make you laugh while playing.  again super easy to learn and super fun to play"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We needed a Mrs. Potato Head to go with our Mr. and little spuds.....Crabby potato mama fit the bill lol.  My kids young and old (3-11 years) enjoy making mama crabby....because mama is sometimes crabby right?  Anywho, this potato is a lot of fun.  My kids really like mixing all the different pieces and creating some rather interesting Potato peeps. The quality of the pieces and potato body are very good. Some of her pieces are a bit hard to push in but I suspect that they will loosen up with continued play.  We have not attempted to store her pieces in her ahem....behind.  No idea if they all fit.  We use lingerie zipper wash bags to store our potatoes and pieces."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My 4.5 year old daughter loved this set! She was able to put it together with a little bit of help.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,My 5 yr old granddaughter was so excited to get this and can easily follow the instructions.  She was introduced to the circuit sets when her 7 year old brother got the 100 project set. He wasn't too keen on allowing her to use the set. This simple beginners set was just what she needed.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My son has a whole fleet of Bruder trucks, and he loves them!  This crane truck is his favorite.  This thing is taller than he is (he's 6 years old) when fully extended, and he uses the heavy metal hook to pick up all sorts of things. These Bruder trucks are excellent quality and they have amazing detail.  Yes, they're a bit expensive, but worth every cent."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Purchased this as a gift for my son, who is obsessed with all things Snoopy.
He loves the classic ""Cutes and Ladders"" already, and this game adds another element to the gameplay making it a little different and interesting."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I got this for my daughter who is dressing up as Ms. Frizzle from the Magic Schoolbus books. She is creating a great costume and Liz here will be her prop. I rearely write a review, but this thing is SUPER cute, and quite a bit larger than I'd expected. We love ""Lizzie."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I've only done one miniature with these so far (not posting a picture because my painting skills don't do these paints justice).

These are great. The paint goes on so smooth, and it dries so quickly. I was able to put on one color, and in the time it took me to clean my brush and get a bit of the next color it was pretty much dry, so I didn't have to worry about smudging when I picked it up.  The only drawback is the paint I put on my little pallet also dried very quickly, so I learned to be very careful not to put too much on the pallet so I used it up quickly, and not to leave it sit for too long.

The metallic gold and silver are great. They really shine nicely.  These are fantastic paints and so much better than the ones I was using."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,This game was pretty frustrating for my 8 year old.  A lot of the cards were very difficult to perform.  Tried it once and that was it!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I received this at a baby shower and was a bit baffled. According to the packaging it is for 18 months. I started using it when he was 6 months. He LOVED it!!! I'd stack he would knock it down. It was his absolute favorite toy for the next 7 months. He can now stack it himself but prefers to nest them. This will now be the toy I give at baby showers!!! I would recommend throwing away the stickers - I did! I also have yet to use the sorting shapes.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,I bought this train set to for my three year old grandson to use with the Step 2 Deluxe Canyon Road & Train Track.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this game to use with children who have ADHD or other behavior problems. I got it on sale for about $10, so I really didn't expect much. (Why else would it be half-price, right?) But kids absolutely love it! Every child that used this game asked for it as soon as they came into my office. My own children love it, too. I used it with kids from roughly ages 3 - 9. They loved taking out the pizzas and getting them out of their pizza boxes. They also loved the silly toppings like a soccer ball or stinky sock. My 3-year-old likes playing the game, but he also likes pretending he is baking the pizzas in the oven (which is the game box). It lends itself well to adaptation and being creative with the instructions. It's durable, survived lots of kids. Kids are very competitive and did not really like that there is no winner, but I did like that aspect. It helped with working on teamwork skills. Great game, especially for the price!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Adorably soft - I bought 5 of these Aurora flopsie plush dogs and they were all adored by the children who received them!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,These were a huge success when used these to facilitate writing activities in a youth writing workshop
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,My daughter received this from Santa this past year just before turning three.  She doesn't play with everything that came with it but she does love the cookies.  We had made Christmas cookies just before Christmas and she loved rolling the dough and using cookie cutters.  With this set you can act like you are rolling the dough and use a suction cup device to remove your cookie shapes from the dough. That in itself makes this a good purchase. Can't comment much on the other pieces but will say that the bread is pretty flimsy. Would still purchase again.
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"The Disney Descendants doll set with Evie and Carlos are two times the fun in a great package. The dolls comes with 2 outfits, 2 pairs of shoes, 1 pair of earrings, and 6 accessories so they each have a change of clothes so you child will have more variety.

The Thing i am most impressed with in the richness in color and detail in Evie's hair. The dark blue/purple really pop's and both dolls are a great likeness to their Disney Show character's.

The dolls are made from standard plastics and are fully articulated for lots of pose-able playable fun.  These would make a great gift for a fan of the show or a little girl who loves dolls."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,It is great fun flying this around inside or outside the house. Be careful flying outside. It climbs very fast and really easy to lose it. Product came very fast and on time. Price was good.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"This is actually a nice looking dragon, but rather angry & violent looking to me.  I bought it for a young nephew based upon other reviews from folks who bought it for younger boys. I should have looked a bit more closely at the pictures,  the dragon is for  a 5 year old male is too scary.  I would recommend the forest dragon for younger kids.  This guy is a bit too much for a little kid.  I gave it to an older child who really loved it, but for younger souls the Schleich forest dragon is a bit more appropriate."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I was really excited to find this. For years I have been struggling with puzzle storage this is genius. Fits thin or thick wooden puzzles no problem! Keeps them together, organized and helps prevent lost pieces! Must have if your little one loves wooden puzzles wish I would have discovered this years ago!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I am giving 4 stars and not 5 because I got an orange set instead of this blue. It's fine, but I like this blue color more. Very rattley! They almost look like little whales - that would be a cute design feature! Overall, Recommended on its own or as part of your little one's music studio. My niece - 8 months - loves instruments and I am building her up a collection, mainly Hohner. Love this company - Hohner."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,All i can say is WOW. Well made. son loves it. Won't sleep without it. Really helpful with the fact his new baby brother of 4 months just moved into his room. Helps cut down the light from changing and getting up with the little brother at night. Fantastic. My new go to toy for birthday presents.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"My sons favorite item this Christmas. Great product holds so many of his figures

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I combined this with my alphabet magnets and it is great! I love the different animals you get. Not only does it promote first words, first letter for a-z, but also I use it for animal sounds. My 13 month old and I love it!!! I would totally recommend it to other parents!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Good lego set. The box came damaged but all the parts were present and it was fun to build with my son. Highly recommended for anyone with kids who like the avengers and/or Iron Man!
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a perfect solution to organize and store puzzles.  We own various size Melissa and Doug puzzles (small, medium and large) and all puzzles fit without any issues.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.

Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.

Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.

Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!

Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"You can play this just to have fun, and accidentally ""cheat"" often, or you can be more serious and just try to get a high score. This game is extremely simple to learn, explain, set up, and play. It's color-blind friendly: there are small symbols on each suit to help tell certain colors apart (in the dark, blue and green look similar and sometimes so do white and yellow). It's also very inexpensive compared to other card-based party games."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We bought this toy for our toddler for Christmas, and she hasn't gotten it yet, but one of her friends has it and they fight over it.  Her friend can't be still for more than 10 minutes, but will play on this for hours.  It plays 9 different songs, and does the traditional sit and spin rotation.  I think it is better than the old sit and spin."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my very intelligent 1 and 3/4 age niece, and she was convinced she had an awesome cell phone she could use."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"UPDATE 1/10/2016:
Despite the poor quality of these items and the doubled price, I decided to buy some more with plans to reinforce the hilt from the inside to withstand normal play.  The sabres have changed!  The buttons now have different and LESS DESIRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.  There is one switch that has an on/off position.  When in the off position, the other button does nothing.  With the on/off switch on, the other switch toggles between on and off- pretty useless!  The saber cycles through the colors and the sounds (which are, at least, still Star Wars sound effects), so that you can no longer select which color blade you want.  What self-respecting Jedi (or Sith, or Ren, for that matter) would carry a saber which has a random color with every swing?????

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

One of the sabres arrived broken out of the box with a tiny piece of the plastic at the butt end of the handle where the speaker is located broken off.  Otherwise, these were (WERE) super cool and fun out of the box.  It goes downhill from there.  Fast.

All three failed in some way after just hours of play, one failing literally within minutes.  On two of them, a flimsy plastic fin broke loose inside the battery compartment, allowing the batteries to migrate around inside the handle, rendering the lights and sounds inoperable.  I was able to repair these two somewhat easily by unscrewing the handle and gluing the fin back in place, but the fact remains that they broke after just a couple hours of moderate play.

On the third sabre, the sound stopped working, again after just hours of play.  I have not attempted to repair this one, and have not opened the handle to see if a solder would fix it since I don't have a solder gun anyway.

Spend a little more on something that might last at least a week.  No, I would not buy this again."
Electronics_5,4.0,CG,"Five stars for functionality. It works. The only problem is that it's not really a stereo, but a pair of ear buds. The ear buds don't fit comfortably in the ear, so it's a little difficult to pair them. If you have a pair of ear buds, you may need to put them on your head and them on the head and then adjust the volume/angle. I just turned the volume up to the right and it didn't work.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to use headphones, but for people who are just looking for a pair of ear buds, this might be a good option.I bought this to use on my iPad mini 2 and it works perfectly. It does not interfere with the screen at all. I have a hard time finding a way to turn it off, but I have a hard time finding a way to turn it off.

I haven't used it with a Nikkor, but I do like it a lot.  I wish I could buy a lens cap for it, but I don't think I'll have to do that.

The other issue I have with it is that it doesn't fit the lens hood.  The hood is a good thing, because it's kind of stiff.  I wish I had found one that was a bit bigger.

Electronics_5,4.0,CG,"Well, I am a big fan of the wide-angle lenses.  These have a wide angle view and are not the best for most situations.  The plastic body makes it difficult to slip it in and out of the lens without damaging it.  This lens is excellent for those situations.  The 2.5x zoom is also fantastic.  The auto focus is so fast that it is very easy to pull off a few items and still get the focus down.  The zoom is also very good, although I have noticed that the zoom range is not as good as I hoped.  I am really impressed with this lens and recommend it to others.This is a very good sound system. I have been using it for about 3 years and I can tell you that it works perfectly. My only gripe is the battery life is not as good as my other speaker system. I have a Samsung phone that I have been using for about a month now and I can tell you that the battery life is just not as good as my system. I would definitely recommend this"

The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.

I've found that it is a bit difficult to navigate the menus. I wish it had a little more depth and easier to navigate the menus. It is a bit easier to navigate the menus if you are sitting on your couch with your phone in the corner of your living room.

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT."

Terminators work perfectly, quality is excellent - the threads turn smoothly and don't ""grind"" the way poor quality ones do, shipping was nearly instantaneous, even though I used the cheapest method."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"It works fine with Ipad 4, continuous traces of variable intensity, no complains of any kind."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"absolute waste of time and money , packed with bloatware and crappy windows 8 , ad pop-ups all over the place and windows 8 sucks anyway"
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"dont like the fit and it is heavy, feels like elderly ear rings on my ear...works good but try wearing it"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"At this price this rig is a steal. Rigs are priced way too high and it's often hard to find a rig at an affordable price. Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.
-You get all the essentials."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"this product is amazing, good quality, and it does apply very well without too much effort in a matter of minutes.  I use the same product for my Galaxy S3 mini, and I usually keep it in my pockets where the keys and coins just take care of it, and there are no major scratches. and the screen looks good."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Really great quality, our 2 toddlers haven't been able to break it yet.  I wish it had a kick-stand (ordered one previously and sent it back since it kept tipping over)."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Nice sound.  For the price range it's a great option. Use it by the pool.  Does seem to take a bit of time to sync.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased this for around $130 as a back up. I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

3.29.2012 Update

Now that I have had it for some time, I would still have purchased another unit. HOWEVER, hooked up to my laptop, it operates much better than on my PC. Not quite sure why this is, but doesn't really matter. At this point I would not call it horrible, just unsatisfactory."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Overall, I really like this case. The rubberized outside feels smooth and sturdy and the pattern is nice, although not glossy as others have mentioned, which is fine with me. It feels like the case will be strong enough to protect my laptop from superficial scratches and such, but I'm not sure that it would prevent more severe damage with major impact, grantedt I don't expect much more given the very affordable price of the product.

The keyboard cover is thinner than I imagined, but to be fair, I've never had a keyboard cover for my laptop so my only comparison was my imagination. It also has some creases in it from the way it was folded and packaged, so hopefully those will work themselves out with time and use. One of the main reasons I purchased this case was for the keyboard cover so that it would reduce the clicking sound while I take notes in class and it definitely achieves that."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Fantastic bag! I looked at and purchased a few other laptop bags from Samsonite, Incase, etc. and nothing comes close to this. They use YKK zippers, have multiple pockets with soft lining to not scratch up laptops, iPads, etc. and this case has plenty of pockets but not too many!"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power.
A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,The sound quality from these small ear bud are really terrific and high quality. you can hear the bass and the highs very crisp and clean. I will definitely recommend them.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"It's great as a mobile projector for presentations and such. The little tripod is a very nice touch and allows for nearly infinite angle adjustments.

That said, don't fool yourself into trying to use it as a tiny home theater projector like I did, though. The native resolution is a disappointing 480p, and the digital upscaling looks very grainy, at least with a PS4 driving it. Also, the focus wheel is easily moved, even by vibrations from being mounted on the same wall as the speakers, so it loses focus pretty easily.

All in all, I'll probably be getting another projector for the media room and using this one for presentations and such when I'm on the road."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Item is inexpensive and works as advertised. Bought it as a pack in with my bare SSHD, as my chasis came with drive mounts."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Worked just fine and seemed to help keep laptop a little cooler.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Very soft and you can wear them for hours without irritation.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Realy love it.  Did wat it says and so much more.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Seagull 1x-2x Right Angle Finder for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta, Fuji, Olympus and Leica SLR cameras is very high quality and it obtains very good image quality.
I recommend this product for DSLRs."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is easy to use, great sound. I brought it to the beach and now use it at my pool."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,These are much better than the Uniden OEM batteries. Having 1400mAh makes a world of difference. My portable Uniden phones last much longer off the base chargers.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Original remote became unreadable after 3 years, all i had to do is put batteries and it worked great."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Mostly ok, but I never found a connector tip that fit snugly in my Compaq laptop.

In the end I used electrical tape to hold the tip in place."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I have had my Escort for a few weeks. I upgraded from a whistler. Right away I noticed a decrease in false alarms. This to me was amazing as the whistler liked to go off at every turn. The alarm sounds of the Escort are much less nerve racking and sounds loudly at first but will then cut the volume down. Another cool thing is the smart cord. This cord has a led only when it is plugged into the radar detector and has another led for when it is detecting radar. Again not in an annoying way. The escort has a dark mode which almost shuts all the led lights off so as not to distract you at night but the audibles will sounds and the smart cord led will light up but since it is down by the cigarette lighter and not in your face it does not distract you from the road. Overall I give this 5 stars hands down compared to the radar detectors I have had in the past.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Works great on my ps4! I would strongly recommend this! Working great still months later.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I own a 2005 Cadillac CTS with a Bose system. If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly. I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.

These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.

These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.

A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""... Do NOT believe it. the rears are 5.25""... I had to return one set 6.5's and I'm waiting for the 5.25's to arrive so I can finish the install.

Amazingly good speakers for the price and Amazon's free freight and fast delivery are great as well."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,I use these for mountain biking and the sound quality is adequate. The thing I really like about these is the ability to hear ambient noised. They are NOT sound isolating like most ear buds and that's exactly what I like about them.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"It is very sturdy and well built and works with my Windows 10 operating system.  I haven't tested it by putting in the washer or dropping it on the ground, but it claims it can survive some abuse.  I would believe it based on how rugged it is.

It is very small so make sure you do not lose it.  My only complaint is that I wish they made these in a 256GB or 512GB models."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"32 GB-  holds a LOT of pictures and movies! Took this to England with me for an 8-day trip, took more than 700 photos and quite a few videos, and still have room for more. This is definitely the way to go! But don't forget to back up your files after you download the photos."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Exactly what I needed to complete the new audio head installation on my wife's 2011 Subaru Outback.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This projector is the best deal! Very easy to setup, I literally got it up in minutes - the only thing I did, unpack from the box, plug in power and plug in VGA cable to my computer. There are a lot of stuff in the menu, but I doubt the average joe will need to use those. I projected to my family room wall from about 20-25' away, the image was bright and sharp. Even after turning on my 300W haligen light, the image is still veru bright. This is a great buy."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,I like my transmitter  for the most part there isn't a lot of intereference like I had with my last one. Though there are still times that I still get it if I try adjusting the volume or heat.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,I'm sure this is good ram. It's the Corsair website that said it would work on my older MB when it didn't.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Was a great cord as long as it lasted.  It is not working now.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Great performance , but rear speakers are a little light in sound. Otherwise, a very good buy! Nice, full sound."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I super love these ...the sound is great and phone conversations are so clear.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is a pretty nice, generic unit that operates as advertised.  Packaging was adequate, arrived a little slower than I'm accustomed to (as a Prime member) because it was drop-shipped...but I'm just spoiled.

This is the recorder and remote only, no cameras, mics, monitor or anything else.  Just making sure you're paying attention!  I've used a bunch of the ""off the shelf"" product from Swann and Q-See in different configurations, and am using some of their cameras with this recorder at home now.

We're really pretty happy with it.  Setting it up to see/change things over the internet would have been a LOT easier with better instructions...but eventually we prevailed.  Be prepared to have somebody who is ""web-savvy"" available to help with this part of the job.

Haven't really put it through any tough ""paces""...we just look at the house, the cat, the street to make sure things are as we expect around the house.  I'm planning to add a ""front door cam"", so we can see who's knocking."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,The device works as advertised.  I like being able to turn each receptacle on and off.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have a Windows Surface Pro 2, a Kindle Fire, and an iPad. This Acer Iconia is a welcome addition. It's lightweight, easy to hold when I use it as an e-reader. It's fast and powerful. I am able to check work email and use the MS Office suite easily on this small form factor. For Windows users, this is a great tablet to have."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Installed this memory into a mid-2010 MacBook Pro. Cheap price and quick installation gave my MacBook Pro new life in five minutes.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,light enough for everyday school backpack. core i3 fast enough for everyday normal use. it is perfect for all student. Unless you are developing large application or hard gamer. This one is just right.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I really like this product. It is good quality and will work with many smaller mirrorless cameras (not just Sony's).  I have used it successfully with my Nikon V1 equipped with the 18.5mm lens as well as an Olympus E-PL3 equipped with the 45mm lens.  My friend tried it today on his Olympus OMD and it fit as well.  The case will work best on smaller mirrorless cameras equipped with medium sized lenses given the way the lens is used to keep the case closed on itself.  Do not hesitate to consider the ""camera pamper"" if you want to keep your camera protected inside another bag or a backpack without taking up too much space."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Good product. Setup was a little difficult. Sound is very tinny.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Overall does what a hub should do. Works 100% with powered devices like printers and scanners. But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,These are very high quality vga cables and they fix a blurry or skipping monitor/tv display that often occurs with cheaper vga cables
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,Never could get this thing to work right. I hook it up to all the right connections; but get no response on the monitor. It has been added to my dust bin of useless parts.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Remarkable clarity and sensitivity. Controls are easy to understand. USB or memory card swap makes it easy to transfer sound files into PC for processing. Fits in a shirt pocket so it's handy when you need it. Very well thought out control sequences. Outstanding product for the price!
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Sound quality is pretty decent for the price, but what this stands out for is ease of use. I have an LG 60LB6300 60-Inch TV and at the very least you can remove this from the box, sit it on the entertainment center below the TV, plug it and the sub in and that's it. With my TV I can send the audio wirelessly which worked well, but I chose the optical cable instead. Even with the optical cable the sound bar turns on and off automatically without exception. The sub syncs by itself, and Bluetooth worked great but I only used it when I first opened the box to hear the sound from this bar. One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month). One caveat with the wall mount is the optical cable plugs in on one side of the mount than has an opening for the wire to go into the wall on the other side. Because of this the optical cable has to be routed under the mount and is slightly visible."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Very nice adjustable load for USB. I got it mainly for verifying capacity of battery packs and battery banks. With a 3-5V input, to 5V/1A output USB adapter and a stop watch I can verify just much Li-ion are OVER rated. (I'll not go down in history for the discovery) With it set for 1amp load the fan keeps the heat sink ambient temperature. Great ""E"" toy, just what us old retired VTVM folks need for entertainment."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great Cable. Love it. Nothing more needs to be said.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Just what I needed, and the price was just right.  I bought it used, with a few scratches and dings, but who cares because it works perfectly for my iPad and Samsung tablet."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This cord is great hands down works great looks great I use them for my beats by dre so it makes the phones look custom.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Don't complain because you didn't know what these are, and thought they were for PC drive power connectors."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Everything the previous reviewers had to say about the sound was absolutely right!  Low in volume and a tinny sound.  My wife and I use in the room to listen to the news while we are getting ready for the day so the sound is almost the most important feature of a TV in that setting.  I really love every other feature of this great TV except the sound.  Wish they would of sacrificed some other feature  or would of just increased the price to compensate for a real sound system!
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,Every time I insert this memory card into my PC it crashes the PC leaving me a USB as my only means of data transfer.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This little book light is great for the price, the light is broad and spreads across both pages and the clip is secure enough not to fall off."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great price. Very fast. Had it for over a year now with no issue.
Durable little thing.
I have owned this for years now and it is always taking punishment on my key-chain and still going strong. Very durable."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is truly a fantastic little class d amp with good clarity and enough punch to drive a few bass notes.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.

Do not hesitate - grab one of these units now before they realize it should be priced higher!!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Timely arrival. Exactly what I wanted. The cord seems to be a bit durable. I'm ordering another for my wife today.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"for the price, this is a good set.
i can't tell more expensive ones from less, so price is a good sorting tool for me.
really only wanted the UV for protecting my lens anyway."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Bought to replace the wireless link to my xbox(needed more bandwidth) and to have a hidden run between the modem and router(gremlin in my office against the modem). Works fantastic on both runs and where painless.

Slight issue with the packaging, the little guide for the wire before the tube fell off during shipping but went back on after cutting the box open. Once that was back on it pulled perfectly without snags.

The wire is grey opposed to the light blue it looks like, not an issue for my attic, only noticed where the wire runs out of the wall."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"If you are buying Def Tech speakers, do yourself a favor and splurge on these brackets.  They make installating quick, easy, and secure."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I've had mine for years and today I have to replace it because of a blackout. Why? There is no way to set the time.

It has run fast for years. It gains 5 min. about every 8 months. So to compensate I set the alarm a little later every year so I can get up at the same time.

Had a blackout and now it is blinking 12:00. The internal battery died. I can't find the manual so I'm looking online to try to reset it. This clock has been the biggest pain in the derriere I have every owned.

I would rather to back to my wind up travel alarm and wind it every day than buy another one of these garbage alarms.

Avoid this auto set stuff. Find some good old-fashioned clock you can set yourself. If necessary, buy vintage and wind the thing every night."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Fast shipping. Screen protector came with an installation kit. Easy to put on device.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The factory ""calibration"" differs dramatically on these. I got two and both display very different colors. Even with adjustment, they are still different. Maybe it is the backlight on one of them. Nice thin bezel. 100mm VESA mount. Got both mine for 119 and 6 months apart. Don't overpay. No ghosting.

Cons - Wiggles when hit. the two I got are at different heights (off by .5mm). I just put some folded paper to raise one. One of them shipped without the screw to attach the base. I just used one I had laying around instead. The led flashed at night VERY BRIGHTLY if the monitors are on. I covered up the LEDs with two layers of duct tape. This is inconspicuous if done properly and helps with the light. Stand is a little big, but not too noticeable."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,It was everything I expected it to be. Really happy with this purchase. It was clear and has focus.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I'm using it right now. It's just the right size for my hands (I wear large gloves). Of course it's not going to fit into your palm, cuz it's small, duh. But it's easy to hold by the fingertips. The buttons and scroll wheel have nice, satisfying clicks and it slides easily."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great battery life, it actually is able to maintain it's own charge and charge another device in full sun, love it for around the pool!!!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Perfect adapters at an unbeatable price.

Remember, these do not step up/down voltage. If your device is 110v (US) and you use these to plug into 220v (EU) it will destroy your device.

Make sure your appliance is rated to the power source, including the frequency (50 or 60Hz, depending on country). Frequency will not immediately destroy your device, but will definitely shorten its life.

Device input power requirements should be on the cord or where it plugs into the body."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Outstanding styling; I wish the forward screw was a pan head as it can rub against your head band.
Going to be stocking stuffers for my kids if they don't sneak mine away first.

[edit] Seller continuously hounds you with e-mails for reviews to the point that I have had to create a SPAM filter for their e-mails. I understand checking in to make sure I'm happy - and to perhaps encourage me to write a review. But (1) A single e-mail will do, and (2) I've bought from them before. So they have a review. They should know that.

So the product is great but buy knowing they'll hound / spam you with e-mails."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great Binoculars....small enough to carry in a purse and great viewing.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,I'm partial to Garmin for gps products...great to have on the road.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Makes my headset a lot more comfortable.  These ear covers seem exactly like the ones that came with the headset originally.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased this with the single intention of Vudu Disc-to-Digital.  For that purpose it works great.  It is a little loud for my taste, and heats up quickly. Which makes me glad i am not using it for other purposes."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Doesn't seem to work well with Mac devices. My USB 3.0 hard drive keep connecting and disconnecting repeatedly.

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

I will tinker with it a little more but if I cannot get it to stop this connecting/disconnecting to stop I might have to return the unit and look for another alternative."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years. No wonder there are so many refurbished 1412s out there! One star ONLY for lack of durability, but that is BIG."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This was purchased as a gift for our 19 year old who has a real interest in photograph. He has fallen in love with the Nikon gem and is rarely seen without it. Easy to use - great photos as well.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"These cables are bulletproof, top quality and very well made."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"We bought this TV two weeks ago. Ordered from Onecall via Amazon. TV arrived very quickly, in fact so quickly we had to postpone delivery so that we could be home to receive. Onecall delivers via a regional carrier which dropped it off in our garage.

First impressions. TV screen is huge. The TV itself is fairly thin and weights just under 100 lbs. Although it might be obvious, don't buy this TV if you are going to be watching it from few feet away. Too close to the TV and regular cable will look fuzzy since the low resolution is magnified to a 58 inch screen. Amazing picture quality with Blu-ray without any optimization. Regular DVD and HD cable have an excellent picture as well. We are viewing it from about 12-14 feet which i think is optimal. No motion blur with action sequences.

There isn't too much glare appreciable even a sunny room in our house. The viewing angles are excellent which is one of the reasons we choose plasma over LCD.

The audio speakers are okay to good but you are better off with a surround sound system if you have it. The TV does have a faint buzzing sound that you can hear if you turn off the volume. It isn't annoying and I believe it goes away as the TV warms up.

Overall, a great TV for a reasonable price ($2099 is the lowest recently offered.) If you are looking for a large plasma, check it out."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This works very nice and I haven't had any connection issues so far.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"after geting mine the unit fell off the ring it was atached to as a little swing pressure on the unit caused the 2 halfs to spread thus leting the atached ring fall out. the first time it did it on my driveway and i did not find it till after I ran over it about 4 times I fixed it by using some super glue to make sure the two halfs no longer spread and it working fine to this day but I also suffer from the week latching when it is extended but that a dealable issue for me as all you have to do is keep for finger on the button.

update apr 2012 7 years later works just like new after seven years in fact the only problem is it gotten so small in size as 512 does not cut it anymore"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"...or any of the other 'slim' Powershot pocket-sized cameras that are the same size.

It fits in snugly and provides great protection. The case is well padded.

The carabiner on the one we received is elongated rather than round as shown in the picture here. It comes off if you don't want it on there."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I take regular pictures of the Sun (with a filter of course) with my Rebel EOS T3i. Typically I use a cardboard box to provide shade for my camera and laptop. However with this hood I can, most of the time, just use the camera and the shade this hood provides. I would say that if you do a lot of picture taking in sunlight and have to use the LCD screen, then this is a 'must have'."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"It's a crap shoot whether or not my Alienware laptop will even boot with this thing attached. When it works, it's great, but it's so finicky that I never want to hook it up because it might take me 2 hours to get my computer started if I do. Very disappointed in this purchase.

Also, Dell makes it nearly impossible to find the software for this thing on their website. It is not detected by their support helper application and does not seem to have the ""service tag"" that is needed to find drivers and other software for your machine. There's tons of software to choose from one you do find it, but it's pure luck to download and install the correct software as everything is named the same and not labeled appropriately for specific machines and operating systems (it LOOKS like it is, but I have downloaded many packages for this device that indicate my specific laptop and OS, only to get a message that says :this software does  not work with this machine"" upon trying to install. Hugely frustrating and a gigantic fail on Dell's part."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Much more durable than the corresponding Apple case for a fraction of the price.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Camera is over rated and pictures are NOT amazing quality. It is fine as a back up camera, but I would be very disappointed if this were my primary camera."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I have 4 tablets; HP G2 10"" android; Dell Venue Pro 8"" windows; Vulcan Excursion 10"" windows and an Ipad Mini-2.  These work on the Ipad about 60% of the presses I make.  The Dell they work on about 1 in 5 times I press it to the surface.  The HP they work about 7 our of 10 times and the Vulcan hardly at all.  I don't know why they act this way.  I have an iHome stylus/pen (looks like a pen with the rubber tip at the top part) and it works 80-100% across all devices.  The company is great, they send follow up emails and the package is nice.  I only received 1 lanyard but it's ok; I didn't contact them to send another.  For me at 7-bucks they're thrown in the drawer and my iHome pen is clipped in my Venue Pro case.  They're built well but just don't work great on any of the 4 tablet devices I have, eh?  Get 'em if you've tried a friends on your device and they work. For me, not so much and if I require another stylus it'll be a 2nd iHome pen/stylus.  Great contact/sales follow-up; product about the cost of a burger lunch and as memorable."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

All that said, it's a great addition.  If you can afford the cost-of-entry, you'll be amazed how shallow the system feels with it off."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"This thing was lame. It didn't even work when we got it. It's really light weight and feel like it's cheap. We ended up going to Best Buy to by a different one that would do the job right. The bad thing is we waited too long and when we wanted to send this thing back, it was already too late to get a refund."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Nice, simple, basic, small.  Purchased as a gift, so I can't speak from experience, but I did open it up and look at it.  Was a good fit for a small Nikon Coolpix."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is perfect for what I was looking for.  I had a nice pair of small desktop speakers I wanted to hook up to my PC.  I had the amp connected to the computer in about 5 minutes.  The sound is fairly clean - and I can't really tell if its not totally clean because of my cheap sound card or the amp or the speakers.  For the price, it was a great deal."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Thermaltake Mobile Fan 12 External USB Cooling Fan 120mm AF0007 , Got this fan and the Coolerguys 120x120x25mm USB Fan with Grill, both are great, this one is strong to 6"" in front of it, the Coolerguys is strong only to 4"" in front of it, after that the airflow is not noticed as much if any. I got these to use for my DVR boxes, if you put a fan over the hdd of the DVR box, your box will last for years, otherwise every 2 or 3 years they will crap out on you, my DVRs have been here for over 5  years and I have 3. I think both fans are great and if you want control and more power then go with the Thermaltake, for DVR you only need about 2 inches of airflow so both fans are doing great for me. Hope that helps you a bit."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Someone obviously used this for a photoshoot then returned it to Amazon. Since I bought it at a great discount from the warehouse, I could care less since it's 100% functional."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Stopped working after 2 weeks. The company had tech support call and they fixed it. I was impressed. They care for the customers!!!!!!!
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.

I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Used these cables to hook up blue ray dvd players.  Works just fine and the price is right.  Shipping was quick.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I've used this camera ever since attending a One Direction concert. It made the concert so memorable because of the hi def recording feature. The pictures all turned out wonderful. It's an easy camera to use and I'm very happy with my purchase
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I read some negative remarks on the pack but thought it was a good choice considering it had over 200 positive remarks.  For $48.00 I couldn't have found a better bag.  It has plenty of room  and the quality seems to be pretty tough.  It's not a 250.00 tamrac  but for the money I would say
it's a better buy."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is the best option i've found for wiring a speaker-level output from a receiver to an RCA style input on an amp. The female to female connectors will come in handy too.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,The device stopped functioning after the first use. Changed battery a few times but would not power on or record audio when attached to the camera. The build felt cheap and I regret not saving a little and going with something a bit more expensive with higher quality.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Solid well made stand - Bought another one for my wife.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Easy to install works perfectly, extended the range of my Wireless connection by 50 feet."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,My second one. Hope it is as good as the first.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I bought two of these in September of 2012 - purchases were separated by 12 days. Well, one in my fathers Samsung Galaxy S2 died 10-15 days ago, and the one in my Samsung Galaxy S3 just died today, 2/20/2013. It seems they have a short life span - just 5 months, or I was just lucky enough to get 2 bad ones.

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

I am giving it three stars because they worked just fine while they worked. I have a ticket opened with Sandisk as I am past the 90 day window with Amazon. I'll see how they respond, and if they will send me a replacement, and then I might update this review."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Fit my TP-1a perfectly.
This is as good quality as the original ones that came with my (then) $150 headset (2009).
Great stuff for the price!"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is a fantastic backpack. Very stylish. Plenty of room. The zippers are good, but the ones for the laptop go too far down, into the side pouches, so they're hard to get at sometimes. It's a minor thing, but Thule could improve this, I think. Also, the hard case is HARD, and, it causes the shell to collapse. Some kind of ribbing in that area to keep the shell out, and prevent it from caving inwards might be a good idea."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"These look so real it freaks visitors out, out of the four units only three had led lights that worked when I installed them.  After four weeks two are still working.  I put fresh batteries in them but still only two still have the red LED working.  If all the LEDs were working I would give them five stars."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,These are amazing.  They work as intended and tapping in to the powered mirror is easy.  This helped hide the wires in both of our cars.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,Every once in a while it drops the connection from the router. Don't use it anymore.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"TI chipset, works great for audio over FireWire (I tried it with 32 channels at 48kHz/24bit)."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Been using this motherboard for months now, without any problems."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I received this product 2 months ago and I love it. I swim laps twice a week and it can be boring, being able to listen to an audiobook while swimming allowed me to stay focus. I recommended this product to a lot of my friends."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Surprisingly, this flat piece of plastic (with silver inlays) actually works, bringing in all 19 available channels in my area. However, you really do have to find the sweet spot on your walls for it and that might require a longer coaxial cable than is provided with the antenna."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,Connections are light duty and can break as mine did. It should come with a power supply as the connector is metric and was a little difficult to find a mate that fit.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I just had to hide those showing wire and hide them from my sight and now I do not notice them at all in plain view.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I was skeptical at first, but it's a good little speaker for the price. I use mine out in my garage where I don't need Bose speakers while I'm doing wood working. As an added little bonus, it will shut itself off if you disconnect the Bluetooth for too long. I forget to turn it off on a regular basis, but it can save its own battery."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this monopod in anticipation of a week-long vacation. I wanted an alternative for taking photos on day trips where I wouldn't need to lug along my full tripod.  When the monopod arrived, I was amazed at how lightweight the whole ensemble was.  In it's little carrying case, it seemed to weigh less than my cellphone.  Plus, completely collapsed, it fit perfectly into the bottom of my messenger bag.  While taking pictures, the monopod helped tremendously and I barely ever regretted bringing it along.  After the vacation, it stayed in the bottom of my bag and I haven't been bothered by keeping it there.
My only slight minus to the product is the rubber washer that goes between the pod and camera came unglued after the first time I screwed the camera on.  However, I just used cement to put it back in place and everything works fine."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"So far (had it for almost a week) very please with this case. It arrived in a very timely manner, and the keyboard charges and pairs with the iPad Mini as advertised.  The sleep/awake iPad function works ok so far, though it needs to be lined up properly to work, and this happens without too much trouble. The materials and workmanship are good. For the price, I would say you get what you paid for and would meet most people's expectations."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"So far, so good. I've had it for a few months but have only used it a hand full of times. It works well and I haven't had any issues beside with the instructions: they weren't very clear. It appears as though it doesn't work, the first time you use it, unless you press down the button on the back for longer than a few seconds. Other than that, I've had no issues. It works well and a decent price."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Helps to keep my Jaybird Bluebuds in ear without the wings, works great, hold up long, don't get too nasty and i just wipe off on shirt if they come out with a friend (sorry gross but it doesn't look dirty afterwards)"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Nice fit.  Safe rubbery feel while not being to large.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This tower is big for a mid tower but I like it

Came warped in plastic

Clean Nice paint job

Cant complain yet great tower!!!"
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I give this 2 stars as I am not just throwing it out.

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great little speaker!  Connects right to USB port, not bulky!  Nice to have while just lounging in bed or on couch and need a little more sound!  Excellent sound quality!!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"So far for the price, my wife and I love these Bluetooth. Very easy to use, and no trouble with the ears hurting from the ear hook. Thank you."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"It's a great bag. It is small though, so if you're looking to hold more than 2 cameras, you should go with something bigger. I like it because I wanted to be able to carry multiple cameras and accessories and I hate the messenger bag styles. It's got study construction and the interior is a really nice red. The straps are padded and my sweat doesn't seep through and make everything wet because its waterproof. I would buy again, for sure."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I bought this so I could transfer photos from my SD card to a USB stick for on-the-road photo backup.

This product is designed to complete the task, however it is unable to fulfill its purpose.

The App will been to transfer photos, but then stops and quits about 30 seconds in.

So you can transfer 1 file at a time, but if you have more than 1 digital photo to transfer, it won't work.

I'm going to put my unit in the trash as I don't need more electronic junk in my life.

Next time I will just bring the laptop!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"UPDATE: Shortly after writing this review I was contacted by i-BLASON customer support who informed me that they have sent me out a replacement case. That is awesome and deserves 5 stars in itself! Hopefully I just got a bad one and it won't happen again.

If I would have written this review immediately after receiving the cover I would have given it 5 stars because it does fit good. I got the frost since it is semi-transparent and still shows the apple logo on the back. I noticed today that all four corners are cracking. I have not dropped my iPad or mishandled it in any way. I even keep it in a Griffen sleeve for extra protection. I see that other reviewers are reporting the same issue.

I will wait for something else to come out but for now it is still protecting my iPad well enough but I am afraid that the corners are going to gradually chip away and expose the metal."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Cool color for a girl.  Ive seen others that cover up the back a little better than this one but other than that it does the job
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,I am using this for a door stop now. count it up to lesson learned and just bought a new tri-pod.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Used this on my first build. Very quality product and included hardware. Looks good. The Included fans look great and are very quiet. I had plenty of room for my equipment on the inside. Lot of room for additional fans. I added 2 more and found magnetic dust shields to fit over the unused open fan holes. Corsair makes quality products. Highly recommend it.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Worked great with my USB 3 dock to give me a third monitor since I needed to change the Display Port on it to a DVI or VGA for the monitor I was using.  No issues, and can't beat this price.  Shipped quickly."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I ordered this while waiting for a less expensive model to arrive from China. This unit is worth the price difference. Extremely well built. This one will last.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"love it. charges fast. really fast. really really fast :) When plugged in, and in use (screen on), it still charges, unlike previous adapters i used that died on me on long drives even though they were plugged in and charging."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I guess they're...okay? For the price, maybe they're not so bad. What drives me crazy is that there is no ""disconnect"" button. When you turn on, it automatically connects to the last paired device. So if I want to connect to my kid's device, but my phone is turned on and it was connected to my phone previously, I can't make it disconnect. I have to go to my phone and turn off Bluetooth before it will allow connection anywhere else.

I'd love to be wrong about this and will change my review if so, but it seems it just can't be made to disconnect.

As for audio, they sound like low end headphones. Better than earbuds, but nothing of note. The ear area is a touch small so if you're an adult, they might feel squishy."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I have had this lens for about 3 weeks and I'm very happy with it.  I take my camera everywhere so i don't normally have a plan.  I wander around seeing what I encounter so a zoom like this is perfect for me.  I have found the focus to be fast and accurate.  I'm using this with a Nikon D5100.

I can't disagree with the comments regarding some of the limitations, but for what I do it is great for me.  Here's a shot I took the other day [...]

I'll add that I got this at my local camera shop. They got the Nikon mount in before Amazon did."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Great sleeve except it's so snug that you wouldn't be able to fit the surface in it with the keyboard on. I have to remove the keyboard and put it on the back pocket. Other than that, I love the design, material, magnetic closure, and the designated loop for the pen."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"There's a hum that disappears when I turn on my itouch, but it is annoying when I turn it on. But the price was right for the little I use it."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Belkin seems to be the one company that comes out with the best tablet covers.  This Samsung cover is not bulky but with giving you a good amount of protection.  It is bendable so that you can stand your tablet while multi tasking leaving you hands free to do whatever it is you need to do.  I got a black one and it is the basic color for everyone to use.  I would have liked to see better grips on the inside to hold my tablet with but this will do for now.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I really think apple has missed the mark advertising the iPod touch mainly as a game machine. The apps are extraordinarily useful. I'm very glad I decided ( at the last minute ) to get the 32 gb model. I'm not using the iPod portion that much --some music and podcasts, but the add on apps have been very VERY useful. The screen is gorgeous , the keypad easy to use. If I had to quibble I'd say my biggest gripe is that flash and shockwave don't work yet. I know why apple has done that, but it's inconvenient. Youtube videos are fine. Battery life okay if you aren't on the internet the whole time -- i am, so it gets about five or six hours. Wifi reception has been excellent. Built in speaker is tinny and not loud enough, but i rarely use it so i didn't take off for that. There's an app to share files with your computer wirelessly, which is handy for transferring  stuff via webdav connection to read later when you have no connection. Another app lets you capture articles from news and web sources to revisit later. There's even an app to make voip calls from the touch. (you have to add earphones with a mic -- picked up a pair on amazon for $7 and now make occasional calls via Internet. there have been a few times that I REALLY missed not being able to connect when away from wifi, but I do not miss the 2 yr contract to at&t. if you have wireless handy and don't need a full service phone contract this is the answer."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I travel a lot and needed something compact that provides extra outlets and USB connections. This worked perfectly.

Update: 2017
I've owned this product for almost 2 years and its still holding up well. I've used it on every out-of-town trip I've had since its purchase (50+ trips) and its the most important accessory in my laptop bag. Would recommend again."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I wanted to like this.  It seemed like it would be perfect for travel - I wouldn't have to haul chargers,  just cords & this strip.  Well,  I just tried everything out.  The 3 power outlets all work,  but only 1 of the 3 usb ports works.  Guess I picked the wrong power strip.  I don't I know how hard it will be to return or exchange it, but due to 2 of 3 usb ports being dead,  its not much better than any cheap old power stripI have laying around. Glad I ordered far ahead of travel so I can find an alternative.

Will change / update 1 star  review if I get a replacement on which all features work."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Nothing to add to this. It is no different than the original power adapter and it works. There is nothing new to it.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,The only thing I hate in a set of headphones is when they are designed with the right ear plug being the main (long) wire and the left ear plug is a shorter wire that comes out from the main right wire. This is a design feature that is so incredibly uncomfortable to me that I had to throw these right into the junk drawer. I wish the manufacturer would have stated this. What a waste of money.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Worth the extra money to buy the color screen.  My 88 year old father-in-law loves this!
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,did not fit on my background stand so I have never gotten to use this. The inner tube is too small to fit on the stand.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The folks at Belkin make quality products, and this case is great companion for the Kindle Fire HD 7"".
Really great of you are watching a movie or TV show.
Recommended."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Very solid and durable cable, which allowed me to easily run my surround sound speakers.

We were using bare cable before, which constantly wriggled around and caught feet and broke away from the speaker. With this, and a Wiremold kit, everything is solid, mostly invisible, and best yet AWAY FROM THE KIDS AND THEIR WIRE-KILLING WAYS!

Be aware that I wouldn't recommend running more than 100W peak over this cable, due to the 18AWG thickness. If your receiver peaks higher than 150W, for safety sake use 14AWG or lower, as thickness increases as the number drops."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Super easy to set up with GPIO pins and runs the screen and the Pi off on power cable if configured correctly.
I use this for running kali linux on the go. The onscreen keyboard is decent, but I much prefer using a usb bluetooth remote.

The screen came flipped, but was very easy to change."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this right after Christmas to use with my new iPhone.  It may be me and my klutziness, but it took me a while to position this in my ear so that it will not move or fall out.  Once you get accustomed to that, the piece is light and comfortable and easy to operate.  The sound quality is excellent and everyone tells me that my voice is ""as clear as a bell"" when I use this piece.  It's SIMPLE to set up and the controls, volume adjustment, etc, for me, have been a cinch.  Less meaningful to me is appearance, but it does look cool.  It has a sleek design and is not obtrusive.  I sometimes wear it all day and, unlike other headsets I've owned, is doesn't get ""heavy"" or uncomfortable.  Sometimes, I'm not even aware that it is on my ear.  This is my third Plantronics headpiece and I've had good luck with everyone of them. I would recommend this headpiece easily."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is a quality product and durable. I can see having this product for over a few years, and worth paying a bit more for."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,It is working as I expected.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This camera has been termed ""entry level"" far and wide.  So be it.  I find it to be a wonderful camera for what I needed:  A camera that had fast, crisp autofocus and could take shots at a speed faster than every 3 or 4 seconds (which seems to be the typical recovery/ready time for most point and shoots in my experience).  Plus, I am rediscovering the joy of artistic photography with this camera.  I'll let the professionals argue over the value and performance for them, but for me, this is a winner!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This works really well, i know some games aren't meant to handle this but the ones that can, my goodness. Thank you for offering this product."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is my second purchase of the Infinity Kappa 693.91 3-way, 6 x 9 co-as speakers. They are great sounding in both cars (Corvette/Van) and can handle a lot of volume.  I would highly recommend them and would purchase them a 3rd time if needed."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The battery lasts a long time and they look very nice, but the sound just is not as good as I wanted.
They charge up fast, they are comfortable, but my $30 corded studio headphones sound better.
I really wish these sounded better, but they are just a little too flat.
They are good workout headphones however
The build quality is very nice they look attractive and seem solid to the touch, they have a mic so i would reccomend them as workout/spoken word/gaming/phone calls. I would not reccomend them for listing to musoc for the joy of it, save up amd get something better"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is the camera that DxO Labs gave the following rating for:
""No need for suspense: this new 16.3 MP sensor is simply the best APS-C we have tested so far, sometimes able to compete even with very high-end full-frame cameras.

The overall score of the K5 puts it in the lead with 82 points -- more than 9 points better than the D90 or the Alpha 55, and 16 points ahead of the Canon 7D or 60D. The K5 is literally the best APS-C performer for each segment, even in low ISO"".

I am no professional. I had used a basic DSLR prior to this the k2000. So this review is based on someone upgrading from a beginner SLR to a more sophisticated one.

Pros:

Low light: This is a camera that takes great low light pictures, you can push the ISO up pretty high and still get great pictures. This was the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I had a hard time taking pictures of my kids in various performances with terrible lighting conditions. Obviously one needs a good lens. But with my old camera I had to throw too many away. This camera combined with the DA 50-135mm lens is one terrific package for such situations.

Weight/Size: this is the most compact camera at such a level that you will find.

Weather resistant: This is a weather resistant camera! Combine this with a weather resistant lens and you are all set.

Electronic Level: I thought this was a gimmick but after using it for a few days, I find it indispensable to take level photos.

User Selectable Focus points: these are standard in expensive cameras, nothing special if you have used such cameras before but for somone upgrading I quickly found out how convenient this was.

Shake reduction: Pentax unlike Nikon/Canon has shake reduction built into the camera, so any lens you put on it has shake reduction function.

Lenses: Pentax has small pancake lenses called limited lenses. Try these if you are new to Pentax. They are superb and great to walk around with without looking like a dork.

Cons: Expensive..."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Removed one star because it's not a tool-less design.

The screws are *tiny*, but they included a cute little screwdriver so they get points for that."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I am totally impressed! Works great and is wifi and wireless...I am so pleased!
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Nice color, good case."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I bought this as a gift for my wife to go with the tablet I got for her. It's very well made and laid out.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"These speakers were a great value replacement for the stock system. There is nothing special about these other than the frequency range is good and they don't distort. They are not very loud, although I am running them with a 4x50W Pioneer and Pyle Components up front that blast these away. Once I get an added amp for the components, I will see how they do with 200W, they will probably be able to handle more volume and distortion with more power available. I am satisfied so far and have not been disappointed yet. If you are interested, I'd recommend these for anyone looking for a good decent clean sound without any problems."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Sound is not that great; get what I pay for
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great kit for cleaning your SLR. I used this to remove the oil spots on the sensor of my D600 and it worked like a champ. I like the little pen cleaners too and the blower is pretty solid.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Hated it.  I should have checked the size--it's smaller than you'd think.  Too small; even if you're used to an Apple Magic Mouse, as I am, this is uncomfortably short and flat.  Instant carpal tunnel.  The movement is awkward, the gestures across the top don't work very well (though admittedly that could come with practice.

Be warned that unlike most Amazon items, you'll have to pay return shipping if you don't like this.  My advice, if you're considering it, is find a store that carries them and try it out first."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This little unit pulled me out of a pinch after a failing USB Boot drive. Installed the old hard drive in a couple minutes, booted right up and ran my installer from this. Worked like a charm, was cheap too on price."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Nobody can see the screen but me, plus it also works as an antiglare. Exactly what I was looking for."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,the build quality was nice and had everything i needed for the build.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Just installed these speakers replacing a set I have been using for many years.  They are solidly built and work great.  Much better sound than I expected based on the low cost.  Would definitely recommend to people looking for a reasonable match of quality and price in desktop PC speakers.

Pros:
Small size
Power supply built in
Great sound

Cons:
None so far"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Bigbox store wanted 4 times as much for a shorter cable,
use it daily plug/ unplug, roll it up throw it in my laptop case, don't treat it very well and it still works!"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,There are surely prettier connectors or there but this does the job equally well and is relatively inexpensive
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is not an amp to impress your friends with.  I bought because the previous owner of my car put extra speakers in but the head unit they sold the car with could handle all of them so I bought this amp to supplement the power.  Sounds fine, I did have a problem with alternator whine and I did everything I could to get rid of it eventually I bought a suppressor and that worked."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Have been using this mouse for around 4 years now. Has served me wonderfully through thousands of games of League and countless hours on minecraft. This mouse senses any damn surface you put it on; carpet, pant leg, bare desk, whatever. It even worked semi decently on a glass top table. Still works great. Gets a 5-star because it fits a $10 pricetag WONDERFULLY."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,This Optoma projector died after 2 years. I've been replacing 2 lamp bulbs in a year and now the color wheel went bad.  The noise of this projector is annoying and horrible. Don't waste your money on this projector.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Love this but its very flimsy legs and the remote worked for 1 day :(
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Honestly, these headphones were quite mindblowing, and a solid step up from the Panasonics which are so popular here on Amazon.

The sound quality made me feel ecstatic, and seems appropriate for all genres. I simply love blasting these things and hearing a surprisingly high level of detail in my music. Plus, the wires stay smooth and separated. Sadly, the earbuds don't isolate noise so well, as I often ride bike / go jogging with these, you can hear the wires rubbing and the wind interference, causing you to boost the volume in such situations. But for every other user, you can't go wrong!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Dont even know its there very quite.  looks good on my desk and no problems so far. Thank you Western. Easy to install also.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying. It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,High quality case. Its on the heavier side but the quality is nice.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I purchased both the CD and DVD size.
The lids do not fit well as they are too big, really big.
In my opinion, excessive care is required in handling the boxes, otherwise snaps can come apart and the contents spills out.
I really wanted these to be good but I ended up throwing them away and now I use conventional plastic storage boxes."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I received this UPS a couple days ago and found it was fully charged when I received it.  This is my first Tripp Lite UPS.  I have been a loyal APC user for my entire computing life.  I figured I would see if TL is any better.  I was surprised that the battery was already hooked up and fully charged when the device arrived.  I let it run for two days.  First day had no load and second had a minimal load.  Tonight I installed the unit in my media center.  So far I have had no issues and no smell as reported by others.  I currently use this UPS in my media center to keep a TV, sound system, CATV box and DVD running.  Current full load is without the DVD and usage is at 37%.  With everything turned off, I still see a draw of 9%.

The only thing that is slightly annoying, and why I gave this item a 4-star review, is that I cannot figure out how to turn off the LCD display when I did not need it.  It is a nice night light in the living room, but I would rather have the display go out automatically or even manually.  I read documentation offline and online and found no clues.  I sent an email to tech support but haven't heard anything after 3 days.  Guess I will call their Chicago phone number and ask.  Unfortunately I only remember to call after they close.

Otherwise, the unit seems to be solid.  Minus the inability to figure out how to turn off the display, I am happy with my purchase.  Time will tell if I switch to Tripp Lite, try someone else or go back to APC."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"We purchased this for an 8 inch polaroid tablet and it fit's perfect, exactly as advertised and what we needed."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,I prefer the sound of these to the A5+. I think the A5+ is over hyped compare to these. With these you can skip a sub woofer if you live in an apartment. I couldn't afford to keep these thou because the price is a factor to me
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"case back cracked on corners within first week and proceded to warp.  The case would not stay attached to the ipad, it simply fell off after being attached.  The JETech slim-fit case is a much better choice for a budget case"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Absolutely awesome Mic. I make hundreds of videos. Awesome. Please bye.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Love this case, fits my MacBook Pro 15 Retina perfectly. I tried the Speck and had problems with the tabs coming off. This case doesn't scratch your MacBook and was designed to protect it. Yeah, it gets minor scratches on the case like it was designed to do but the real reason I bought it was to Protect my 3k investment. Also, it wraps the edges very nicely and fits with a carbon skin installed on it. A+ for a well designed and very reasonably priced shell."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This battery works great!  I'm so glad that it's still available for purchase.  My old Coolpix battery died 6 years ago and purchasing a replacement back then was really expensive.  I'm so glad prices have come down and I get to use my old camera again!
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,This is the right one for old model Sony Camcorder .
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"These are great headphones for casual use. I wear them to listen to music on my phone as I walk to/from/around school, and when watching videos on my laptop.

PROS:
- They are indeed light, and very sleek. Don't look bulky at all.
- They have great sound. They don't cancel noise very well, but I didn't want complete noise cancellation anyway (I think it's dangerous when you're walking on the street.)
- They are adjustable.
- They are comfortable.
- They come with a pouch, offering some protection.
- They come with a 1-year warranty by Amazon.

CONS:
- They aren't foldable. I wish they were more compact, the best I can do is rotate the swivel ear cups to a ""flat"" position.
- There aren't that many colors to choose from.
- They don't look or feel expensive. Granted these aren't expensive at all, but ""lightweight"" shouldn't mean cheap-feeling plastic.

I would buy this product again. For the price, it does what I want. Nothing more, nothing less."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,For this price it solid. you get tons of the bells and whistles you can not get with this care for the price range. It stays very cool and it very solid case.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've been in love with the Carl Zeiss lenses for years now, but my older Sony digital had such a slow shutter I was missing pics of my son. This camera takes really fast pictures!!! I also love the setting that allows me to force the camera to focus on a childs face before anything else in the frame.

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I have ordered this item in the past, and it works perfectly. However, I never received the item. There are older iMac computers where I work, and a presentation needed to be given."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"RAM is priced low, yet it is quality and works perfect! Nice upgrade to boost a system while keeping cost down."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I'm using this power supply in my HTPC setup and I love it. It's whisper silent which it great for when I'm watching movies on my TV. My old PSU sounded like a wind machine of some sort. I'm very impressed with this power supply and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality PSU.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I've owned several of these (I lose them frequently), and I love them. They would be a perfect 5, except they come with the terrible U3 software, with no indication of how to remove it. Here is how to remove it:
[."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,YOU MUST remove the plastic prism for this to work. The distortion is ridiculous. Like looking at a carnival mirror.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"For the price, this case just rocks.  You compare this case to a similar one at Walmart and you are going to pay 3 times as much.  Very protective, hard shell cover and then it is surrounded by a rubber cover.  Very effective for impact shock absorbing, specially if you are letting your little ones use the tablet.  It also has a kick stand to view the screen horizontally on a flat surface.  Excellent choice, highly recommended."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I love this product....I am a photography student with the thought of going professional and this was nice and vibrant just like the one in the studio at school.  It came to me wrinkled but I stretched it out and let it hang and they are coming out.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I will return it.

For three reasons:
1) It requires the root SSID to be broadcasted.
2) In repeater mode, it shows up as a dup SSID. Basically if the root AP's SSID is ""Foo"", with this repeater, I see two ""Foo"" on my Macbook Air.
3) Its plug is right in the middle and its body's bulky. That cause a problem: when I plug it in to a panel with two outlets, the other outlet is barely accessable.

I also bought the other repeater TP-LINK TL-WR700N. The TP-link is better. It supports hidden root SSID and it doesn't add a dup. Its plug is on the side so it works well with the plug in the other outlet."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"For around $70, this is an amazing value. It is part of an inexpensive, but (now) great-sounding system for my garage. It is remarkably small and produces excellent output- both volume and sound quality.  I am new to the world of small T-amps and assumed a large/expensive receiver would be required for my setup.  I am so glad I went with this amp- well worth the cost."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,The SD card reader works well with my smartphone. I primarily use it to read the SD card in my Dashcam.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Quality items.  I bought these for modding my PS3 60GB PHAT model along with a 120mm fan, to allow more air flow since those original models get hot and the internal fan sounds like a jet engine at highest RPM.

Great seller, and excellent product."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Love these. Use them for anything touch-screen active: Kindle, iPhone, computer."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Great price and set up was easy. Just remember to go on line and complete the registration as well as the final setup steps. The reception on the Range extender installed in our basement registered  2 sets of bars for strength. My WD MyNet 600 router is located in my office 2 floors above,
The signal strength to my Roku device for the basement TV jumped from Poor-Fair to Excellent after the range extended was set up.
Update:
It's 3 months after initial install and I am having the same problems as other users. The extender drops the connection and needs a reboot.
There is no new FW to update which means there is no fix. Looks like WD just gave up.
My advice, find a different product."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Big at first, but for the 80$ I spent on it, this was 100% worth the buy! you get used to it!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I used this HDMI cable to connect my new Sony KDL46EX640-46"" LED TV to my TiVo Premiere. It's been three weeks and the picture and sound are excellent. I'm not an expert by any means but this cable seems to do just what you need a cable for at a very attractive price. I did take one of the other reviewers advice and bought two to have one handy for a future need. Shipping was very quick and appreciated."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is a slim case designed for all models of the iPad mini. The mini snaps into the pressure fit back and has magnetic three-section lid that turns the iPad of and on automatically. Good case with good value.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Does what it is supposed to for about 6 months then the 2nd output starts to loose sync (may be a heat issue).  Will be watching a movie on the 2nd output and the TV will loose signal, then about 10 seconds latter the signal will return.  This only happens on the 2nd output as others have had the same problem.

Also sometimes the switching wouldn't switch on the first try, would change to a different input and back then it will work (did this from the time it was new).  I just programmed my remote to automatically switch back and forth when I turned on my TV."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Seemed to be ok as far as a tablet computer goes. If the sound output was better, it would be a much better tablet. You really need powered speakers or headphones to get good sound. It amazes me that Asus has not corrected this problem on other models."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I've installed SmartThings in my home about a week ago and it already feels a waste of money. The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.
-Good luck making the basic kit doing anything more useful than sending you an SMS when someone opens the door.

While this might have been a good introduction to home automation, SmartThings are in fact a useless trinket for a few geeks who might have fun solving all the puzzles within its clunky app."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I just moved to a new city and was constantly getting lost so I wanted to buy an easy-to-use GPS unit.  I've never owned a GPS before so I can't compare this product to others, but I was able to make good use of this unit within minutes of taking it out of the box.  The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly.  It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.  I find that more useful than displaying the time to my destination, which in my experience the device consistently underestimates.  Also not sure why they bothered to have the device tell you your speed, since cars already have speedometers.  Still, a very handy device that I now find almost indispensable."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This replaced the original battery in a Samsung Laptop. It snapped right in and worked immediately. We was going to order a new one for $89.00 from Samsung but really thought why would we put that much money in a 4 year old laptop, saw this one for less than $25.00 shipping and all. We made a great choice."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Sticks well, but over time about a year it showed ripples where I slide it in the iLuv case. I need to learn how to get it replaced."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I bought these way too lengthy but since they are excellent cables i don't mind. Will find a use for the 80ft i have left (haha). Get these with some banana plugs and you're good to go.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Nice quality and it worked well for our online wedding ceremony! We set it up on a fireplace mantle behind the officiant and it picked up all our voices well. The mic was hooked up to a hidden Linux netbook that recorded the audio while a camcorder recorded the video. Sound and audio were then fed into a Webex session. No complaints on the audio at all.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is nothing special it's an extra piece for a dslr camera that I needed. Sometimes these reviews are a bit over rated.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,works perfectly. the range and sensitivity is what I expect. this product must continuously improve in quality and price. the only concern i have is the screw they use is so soft and easily dugged out by strong screw driver. overall this is highly recommendable.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"My MacBook Pro gets hot. I have to run it with a cooling fan or it will start slowing down. (In order to keep itself from overheating, Macs manage the temperature by adding more idle processes into the queue until it's cooled down!)

I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).

When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.

This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.

Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.

BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Love my p-Touch - i label everything that doesn't move.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Works great as a mount in my car. I drive a Ford Focus 2012 SEL, and this mount works perfect to mount a camera or a phone above my GPS screen."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"It's very sleek and fits nicely on my keychain, so I won't have to worry about having a flash drive when I need it.  For large files, though, it's much slower than any other flash drive I have.  I bought the 16GB version so I could move large files back and forth between computers, but it's a bad choice for that role.  A 500MB file took almost 3 minutes to save on this drive (avg 3.5 MB/second), compared to a bit more than a minute on an old Sandisk Cruzer drive. If you're moving small .mp3s on and off, you'll love it.  If you want to move big files, you'll need lots of patience -- or another drive."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I had issues with my first two pairs of these headphones as they both broke after a month of use, but after relaying these difficulties to the company, they worked quickly with me and sent me a new pair. They are very comfortable headphones and work great. I have had no other issues with these products at any point during use, whether it be for during work or when I go rollerblading or skateboarding. I am very pleased with the efforts made by this company to make a sincere effort to supply all of their customers with quality products and service, and would recommend if you were going to purchase headphones from any company, to make it this one."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I actually got these to use just as a pocket magnifying glass. I'm sure they're decent when attached to a camera, but they are great for viewing tiny stuff and for getting campfires started without wasting resources."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Nice laptop for a very reasonable amount of money, it came in pristine condition, the only complaint is that some of the description is not correct but if your are willing to put up with little thinks missing here and there it is a perfect laptop"
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"small doesn't last that long, but the price is decent."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Awesome sound for the price. Bought 3 more for  my wife and kids.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I must say I have been impressed with this device. The company seems motivated to continue to improve with several firmware updates since I have had it.  Easy set up easy to use don't hesitate if you are looking to cut the cord.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,The product does not work at all. Try to use it with every USB flash drive that works in all my other USB devices but to no avail. No sign of life or sign of light for any USB mass storage device connected to it.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Works really well.  My wrist and fore arm where getting achy with my normal mouse. This really helped.  Takes a little while to get used to the upright grip but worth it.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"These work great. I bought the same in different sizes for different applications. I would buy again. If you need just a couple, make sure you measure the diameter of your cup holder or whatever, before ordering."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I tried these earhones and I waited and waited and finally when they came I was so happy. Well when I was trying to pull them out of their tight packaging one of them slightly snapped. They  still sounded the same, but they didn't look it. The bass is probably the only thing that is really good about these like I said before. The mids are somewhat there and the highs are almost no where to be found. The sound isolation was okay, blocking some noise while music was playing but my previous Etymotic Er6i isolators did a much better job for 40$ more. I did insert them all the way into my ears, for what seemed to be as far as they could go. All in all, if all you need is bass consider these, if not just look elsewhere.

Oh yeah, I have a newer ipod, so sound coming from it is bound to be good. So there should be no problems coming from the music side."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"So, the original charger lasted about 3 years without a problem, then suddenly had a short at the plug end.  I bought this one to replace it.  The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.

I bought a NEW MOTOROLA charger, and have used it twice now, no issues with the plug and no shorting out.  So I recommend you save yourself my pain, and buy the Motorola OEM Charger (also on Amazon) for $9 vs. the $6.75 that this thing cost."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This bag is the right size bag for my Sony HDR-XR500V camcorder, cables and other accessories (remote, spare battery and memory stick)."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I ordered this to use with my tascam DR-05 audio recorder.  It appears to be a non functioning piece so this was not a good buying experience however due to the low cost I won't bother with trying to return it. I cannot say this wasn't just a faulty unit or whether others have had problems.  I have tried other adapters and experienced the same.problem.  If you need reliability you might just connect your device via the usb connection cable provided by the manufacturer, which is not always a sure thing."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,only found on amazon for me. only amazon provides you with quality hdmi cables at fractions of the cost. its impressive and you don't always need those lengthly ones to get the job done.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great product works excellent for my media player fast and smooth great quality service
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I have used the HP Stream 8 for about a Month.

PROS
1. 200 MB of 4G LTE data per month at no charge for the Life of the Tablet from T-Mobile. That was the MAIN selling point for me.
If you run into any issues while connecting, you can call T-Mobile at 800-937-8997 and their reps are helpful.

2. Full Windows 8.1

3. Good Screen Resolution and reasonably good speakers

CONS
A. Fairly basic design, not sleek or sexy like an IPAD Air
B. Poor battery Life during usage or Standby

SUMMARY
I would recommend this product as it has 4G and Wifi at a very attractive price point from a well respected company.....Hewlett Packard."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,It is okay due to its low price point. It does what it wants to do but the main issue is the white rings. After constant use the white rings loose attachment to the legs and fall off. I recommend saving up a little more to get a Joby Gorilla Pod. However this is still a wonderful few time use product!
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,very compact and fits my devices snuggly so i don't worry about losing them
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,good price for this product! i'm delighted with it! thx ;) i can recommend it for everyone! ;) thx again!
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,These are great for supporting speakers (Surround Back / 5.1->7.1) and complement my Polk system very well.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,No gain control and the volume is extremely low.  Can't returned it as it is past 30 days.  I only use the USB feature now to play mp3s.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,It has a bit of red hue to it.  That's not the biggest problem in the world - make sure to do a white balance correction if your camera allows it.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Works much better then the cooler master I had bought that lasted a year while making horrible noises the whole time.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I bought these for my brother and he loves them!  They are really loud too!
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Item shipped on time and was as described. Excellent customer service. This product works great and is what I needed. My old cord for my external hard drive, the wires were sticking out had to replace it with this one. I highly recommend this product."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"These Polk headphones are awesome.  They adjust easily to fit, and the full-sized ear pads damp out most external noise, making listening an even more enjoyable experience.

The sound quality is absolutely top-notch.  I'd been listening to my music mainly with earbuds lately, but when I plugged these headphones in I started to hear subtleties and nuances in the music that I'd been missing.  They also work fantastic for watching movies on a computer, digital pad, or smartphone.

This headphones' full sized ear pads are soft and extremely comfortable.

No complaints at all.

Highly recommended!

5 stars."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,was a gift but was returned  he bought one too
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Amazing Excellent Happy Costumer. Rubber cover for the keyboard that I didn't expect. It's what I was waiting for. Thanks a lot.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This was a well made case, good quality for a very reasonable price. It was a gift to hold a portable car dvd player (also a gift) and there is plenty of room for the whole system and plenty also for extras. Very happy with it."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is a great price for a filter.  It appears to be glass and protects well.  Hasn't scratched so far.  I would recommend it instead of the very high prices some stores charge.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have had zero issues with this. The size is perfect. Battery life is excellent (ive never charged since the first charge). Always sinks right away. No lag. One thing people say which you should note; doesn't work well for quick use in your lap, due to the folding design. I thought i would never need this, and only have once, but when I did, I had to awkwardly peck on it trying not to collapse the thing. I plan to buy a few for presents for co-workers and family."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,One of those things bought mostly because it LOOKS useful. Seldom use it but when I do it's as close to perfect as you can get for what it's made for.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great price for these batteries, but I ordered the wrong size. Keeping them because may buy something that the batteries will work in."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Works really good. Keep the usb 3.0 fast meaning it is real usb 3.0 cable.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,great motherboard. stable as rock. running amd fx 8320 @ 4.4ghz stock vcore never freeze/errors
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great sound and holds a charge very well. Definitely would recommend.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,It works fine but the caps do not stay on very well. East to lose.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"If you are frustrated by the limited options of having one keyboard and mouse control multiple machines, this is a must-check-out device.

The JUC400 effortlessly allows me to use one Mac or PC, and control two machines simulatenously from it. I can use my PC laptop to control my Mac mini behind it, and effortlessly drag my mouse from one machine to the next. It just works. No need to configure, use complicated server/client setups, none of that.

You simply plug the device in to each machine, and a virtual CD appears that automounts and automatically launches the software. It also handles software updates automatically, including updating the device's own firmware. You never need to load a web site to check for drivers or updates with this device, it handles all of that for you.

Other features like iPad compatibility, and file transfers that really do work at USB 2.0 speeds, are added bonuses. Even without them, this device is totally worth the money, and totally worth five stars."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This case is perfect for my new Kindle Fire.  When I first got it I didn't think I was going to like it...I had to get used to holding it while using the tablet and I kept pulling the Kindle out of it while I played games.  However, after a day or two I got used to the case and it looks great and protects my new favorite toy!"
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,Cable did not work. Arrived dead. Tried it on two different laptops and two different monitors. Can't exchange can only get refund.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Avoid it. The top portion is made of plastic. No matter how I adjust, it will not stay leveled. You will need to get a separate ballhead to mount your camera. The mounting screw is too recessed. You will need to carry a screwdriver to mount a camera."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is a rock solid, cheap, powerful wireless chipset, it has good support in Linux and windows. I've found it truly can hold 800 MBS on transfers."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Didn't fit my 1991 chevrolet Blazer S10, even when it said it would."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I like having black and white as well as different sizes to choice from.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This speaker will fill a good sized room and the bass is great. I use it for teaching and the students can always hear the music.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I purchased this product and there was no option in the tools menu to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3.  When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it.  When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

Between the bad product and bad attitude, this company deserves to go broke."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Not a bad little device. I have owned this MP3 player for several days now and it is everything I expected it to be. Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance. All around it is well worth four stars."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I should start off by saing that my speakers are pretty big and they are hanging at a odd angle.  The mounts did get the job done, but not too sure on if the weight rating is as good as they say.  I think they are one of the best choices in the price range."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great! I can actually hear the individual instruments on what I am listening to. I love getting really hammered on the weekends and watching Youtube and these Etymotic earphones make my buzz more enjoyable
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"It's true the instructions are lacking, but it's one of those things that would be easier to learn by watching someone do it. All the people crying about it's difficult to do it without two people, probably have a chimney that's hard to reach, or aren't that bright, neither should reflect on the product itself. I installed them easily by myself in under 20 minutes."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).
The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.  No more Garmin for us, ever."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"It is a fake arduino, it works but is not genuine..

Also, the reset button don't works, I had to use the one in a modular board I connected on top of if"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Does not have the ""soft"" feel of a leather case - but it is what it is.  Perfect fit - protects the kindle - and easy to handle.  Very sturdy and looks good."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Works just fine. I have it running from my 4K TV to my laptop to play games on it and haven't experienced any issues.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this mainly as an emergency television for power outages.  Works great.  The batteries that came with it are awful, two different unique batteries, expensive to replace and one went bad fairly quickly (it would not hold a charge and it swelled up, popping the cover off of the battery compartment).  I bought the docking station and use Eneloop rechargeable batteries in it.  Out of the package, the rechargeables ran the TV for 2 hours and 15 minutes.  The batteries tend to last longer after they have been charged the first time."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I bought this to use in transferring data among my various netbooks, laptops and desktop computers I have at home and in my workshop. Seemed to perform just fine when connected directly to onboard USB ports, but very, very sensitive to being connected via powered USB hubs. With one system (WinXP home with a powered USB hub) it totally took down the USB bus as long as it was plugged in - not good at all.

So - seems OK as long as you're not using a USB hub. But unfortunately it's a pain for me to disconnect something else in order for me to plug directly into an onboard USB port on the one system."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Purchased these to conceal wires for a wall mounted tv and it worked perfect! It even comes with a template you can trace right on your wall for fool proof instillation. Of course make sure you have a stud finder and drywall saw or other appropriate tools to get into the wall.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I used the batteries for a motion sensor in the entryway of our store.  The batteries lasted a few weeks and are all dead after just one use.  Utter trash.

Edit: after replacing the batteries with Amazon Basics batteries, the charger refused to charge them at all and gives the red light of doom for each and every battery you try to recharge. Truly one of the worst products I've ever purchased."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I didn't like this all to well. It just had a slow reaction whenever I made any kind of move with the mouse (and yes I did every thing on my part to insure the bluetooth and settings where on point). I only gave this 3stars because I did buy this as a used mouse, I guess with any product never buy used......"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Nice Back pack lots of storage room in large compartment. wide wheel base makes it easy to pull over obstacles. Would have gave it 5 stars but the outer walls are not lined as in My Targus laptop backpack.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Had an elderly IDE drive (10GB). Plugged the data/usb adapter into the drive, plugged the power cable into the drive, plugged the brick into the wall (let the drive spin up), plugged the USB cable into my PC and 20 seconds later viola!  There was the drive in XP. Idiot proof. Take your time. It's easy to bend IDE connector pins. Old lab trick: use the opening of a Pentel mechanical pencil to straighten them out if you got cocky. Cheers."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,This card stopped working after 8 months.  I could no longer write to it. I could not format it any longer either. PNY did do an RMA on the device but because of sensitive information that I stored on the device I could not return it. I shredded the device and decided not to trust PNY for any of my memory needs.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Very imprecisely. You have to try very hard to make it work on the screen. Well, I guess the tablet was not designed to be written on anyway so the pen is an OK product to me."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"This is horrible. I bought it to use with a Blu-Ray player I have. I hadn't gotten around to using it until now (past the returnable date) and discovered it won't work. The blu ray drive slipped in no problem, but when I plug it into the computer, it just spins and the computer doesn't recognize it. I thought it might be the driver, so I swapped it with another. Same problem. Not worth the effort."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I have Comcast 75Mb service.  I had a very old zoom 5341J (8x4) running until it died.  I put back in my even older Zoom 5341 (4x4) modem while I looked for a replacement.  I tried the Arris SB6141 (8x4) which worked well until it died.  So I decided to try something else and liked the idea of this 16x4 model.  However, once I replaced the Zoom, it would only achieve 55 Mb/s download.  I tried multiple power resets, but even though it bonded with 16 download channels I would peak about 55 Mb/s.  I put the very old Zoom (4x4) back in and it went back to 82Mb/s,  There are no configurable parameters.  I had expected at least the same performance and possibly better than the very old Zoom."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This card works great and installs easily.  I am a little disappointed in the lack of software to support its functionality.

  I bought this card to be used in a Ubuntu server where I run Plex to serve my house TVs.  Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to install any drivers.  It just plain works.

  What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).  Finally, if you using this for Plex note: only the primary plex account can access the program guide to watch TV, none of the other users you've created can access them."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Installation was a snap.  However, I purposely purchased another pioneer deck to replace my existing one thinking I would not have to rewire the harness.  I was wrong.  Pioneer kept the same connector type but changed the wires around.

But installation snafus aside this 70 dollar deck sounds better than the 300 dollar pioneer deck it replaced.  Fewer fancier options but solid power out and the highs, mids and lows are solid.

AUX in works like a champ with IPOD or any other mp3 player for that matter.

Not a big fan of the RED lighting on the unit but it is not a deal breaker for me.  If you are looking for a deck to push your speakers and on a budget like me... look no further this deck is NICE."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"These were parts for my new home-built computer. The pricing and quick shipping made for an affordable, stress free home-build. Since the computer is working great I don't have any complaints."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"So far the performance has been amazing. Running a i7-6700k with a Noctua NH-L9I and it idles under 30C and has never gotten over 68C. Will definitely buy again for my next build.

I had enough to do my processor and my girlfriends processor. So you could easily use this to do your CPU & GPU off one tube.

The other processor this was used on was an i5-7400 with a Corsair h80i and it idles at 17-19C. The other PC is SFF so that's why it isn't using water cooling and this one is."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I love this product but it is a bit touchy sometimes. Otherwise amazing. Works great with my mac's multi-gestures.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit."

In video you can see its warranty seal isn't broken. and its inside is clean because it was unstable/defective power supply , so it has been hardly used as I also have dual xeon mac pro also. on top of headaches the power supply cause me I have to ship defective PSU on my own cost."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"i cant tell you what size ears i have even more so my inner ear, different products sizes and brands works for different folks, i bought the mixed pack because i wasn't sure which would fit, small are too small, large are too large,. the mediums are perfect for my wireless headphones i recently bought, the jaybird earphones for working out, no slippage, it stays in while working out"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This monitor is a very solid budget monitor. However, the screen was not durable and now there is a dent in my screen."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I used it twice. It worked well. No problems and the price makes it a great value! I recommend it.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Very sturdy surge strip for a solid price. Haven't had my house struck by lightning, so I can't comment on the effectiveness, but I'm trusting $1000 of hardware to it."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Exactly what I was looking for for my C.H.I.P. $9 computer. It paired up no problem, and the keyboard and touchpad work great. It needs to be in Windows mode for the escape key to send an escape. It also works with my Raspberry Pi (with a bluetooth adapter in a USB port). This keyboard with touchpad lets me work with it on my lap with the little computer plugged into the TV for a display. I like that the keyboard is full-size and metal backed for a sturdy feel. This keyboard is better than the Logitech K400 and way better than the Aerb ultra-thin keyboard/touchpad/remote control. I definitely recommend this keyboard with touchpad for little computers like the C.H.I.P. and Raspberry Pi."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"UPDATE 8/8/2012: I haven't had the case/cover for 3 months, yet...and it's already showing signs of falling apart. I use the case/cover at home and for one class I'm taking, and after a short 3 months it's surface material is cracking and starting to peel off where the cover folds (multiple locations). I do like the case, but it's going to look very ratty in a few more months. At this rate I'll need a case every 3-4 months and that quickly ads up over a year's time frame (which would be an acceptable amount of time for a single case/cover to survive).

Old Review: Great case for the iPad. This thing goes in and out of my back pack, loose leaf binder, and around campus. It's a simple design-in black-and most folks don't know it's an iPad until I open the cover. I just need to learn and not show off, so this fits the need perfectly. I would have given 5 stars, but I find the cover sometimes moves enough that the unlock screen will come on. In a side-by-side comparison, the Apple screen cover has about twice the hold of this one, but this one protects the whole device and helps my hands grip what would otherwise be the difficult to handle smooth aluminum back."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've stayed at a lot of hotels during my Army career and current job. The last hotel I was at (Sh@raton) had this alarm clock and I liked it so much I bought it for my house. I really like the gradual alarm beep and the left right switch so you can EASILY set how many more minutes you want to snooze for.

Cant say anything about the radio, I don't use it."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Worked instantly on a MacBook Pro (mid-2017) while using it in conjunction with an Anker USB hub. No config needed and automatically defaulted to priority over the laptop's wireless connection. The only thing I don't like is the repeated blinking light when plugged into a USB hub when the laptop is no longer present.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,The wire was easy to work with as I ran 5 lines and the resultant sound was great. Must have for any home entertainment system.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've been using these cases for years.  Wonderfully compact and safe storage.  We have a large collection, close to 20 cases.

No problems with scratched disks."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Improved design and ease of use compared to predecessor product GSC-10.
I would give 5 stars were it not for the rubber band attachments. How well will they survive 500-600 mile months in all kinds of weather?
I will probably inspect these frequently and look for replacement alternatives. Sync and programming were easy with my Edge 500.
But.... rubber bands for a constantly moving part???????"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I use my Nikon D7100 with 70-200mm Nikon lens regularly and find this holster works extremely well!  I would recommend it to anyone with a similar camera setup.  It is used frequently when photographing many High School and youth sports game year round.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great quality. I've only had it for a few weeks now, but you can feel the quality in the carefully crafted tips. The cable is tangle-free as stated of course and the cloth jacket is of good quality. Now it's just a thing of seeing if they last longer than my last cloth jacketed aux cable purchase."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I love Garmin products but continue to be less enthusiastic of their bike mount systems. This one slips regularly for me, but I do want to share that my Cannondale's handle bars are tapered, and it's challenging to keep any mount in place. It's still far better than mounting your Garmin Edge product on the handle bar stem. The Front Mounts provide much safer visibility during rides, where you need to keep your eyes on the road. For on our rough wine=country roads between Napa, Sonoma and Marin County roads, this mount slips dropping my Edge 1000 point straight down at my front tire. I've been using a third party solution that is much more reliable for me."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Taotronics Bike Phone Mount Bicycle Holder is a great peace of engineering, that is very versatile. Prior to buying the phone mount holder I placed my phone in a bum bag, when riding my road bike. The Taotronics phone mount holder has enabled me to change all this. Now my phone is mounted on my handle bars in front of me. During my 40km rides ""DownUnder"" (Sydney, Australia), where at times the ride can get rather bumpy, my phone sits securely clamped and strapped to the phone mount holder on my handle bars. I find it so much easier to use my phone when riding. Also, it is easier to listen to the feedback on my riding performance during my ride, from the downloaded app on my phone. This phone mount was purchased on 15th March 2017 and my wife was so impressed with it, she wanted one for her bike, which was purchased on 25th May 2017. The recommendation from the seller, to use the rubber strap before you put the holder part and the clamp together on the handle bars, was taken heed of. I recommend both the Taotronics Phone Mount Holder and seller Sunvalleytek. Regards Stephen."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Look, this changed my life.  My wife is not as happy because now I spend money trying to make my favorite games go 144hz at full detail all the time.  But I am happy and out of her hair more often so she is fine with it.

But seriously.  If you can push 60 fps at 1080p all the time and have an AMD card then you should look into getting this.  The difference between 60fps with VSync and 70-100 on FreeSync is amazing.  Things look more real.  Just do it."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.  Bottom line is relly unless you have a ton of time and a load of asprin I wouldn't suggest going for this card... I'll update if I manage to find some kind of solution but as it is it is far from plug and play.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've wrestled with lots of screen protectors over the last couple years; cameras, cellphones, GPS systems, iPods, Kindle 2.  This Green Onions protector was easy peasy and looks great. It looks exactly like the Kindle screen- no glare. It is a little bit smaller than the screen which is a good thing since it simplifies application. It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with. There are two in the pack which is probably a good idea for first timers with screen protectors, but it would have been nice to be able to purchase a single for those of us with experience and established technique."

I feel that this 3M protector is as good as any I've tried, it fits the iPad well.

The instructions were very specific and clear -- better than other products I've tried.  Overall, I recommend this for use with your iPad!"
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Just to be clear, this is in no way a Steadicam and the serious DIY'er could almost certainly cobble up something just as capable himself by putting a handle on a ball-socket tripod head & using a suitable counterweight. Still, for the price, one couldn't expect too much. The biggest downside to this is that it requires more hands than the average human comes equipped with in order to use effectively, coupled with a very light touch & many many hours of practice [complicated by the desire it inspires to just throw it against the nearest hard immovable object during that long learning curve to achieve competence."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I have a dive camera that is good but too much trouble for day-to-day pool and kayak use.  I really wanted the Olympus TG-810 but didn't want another $400 camera.  Picked this up on a trial basis just based on price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Took a bunch of pics in and around the pool and the quality was great.  It's really slow to recycle between shots but all pics were in focus and the colors wonderful.  Love that it has an auto white balance setting for underwater and I don't have to mess with filters.  Will be perfect for kayaking and snorkeling.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Highly functional case and comes with a pen/stylus!  The inner pouch of the case is velcroed to the outer jacket of the case.  To make it stand vertically you have to position the cover accordingly.  The velcro inside case concept makes for an additional layer of thickness.  Also, the case has a magnetic closure but it does not work as a smart cover to sleep/wake up the device like an iPad.  Other than those minor details it's a very good case and provides great protection and functionality."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"First impressions are that this computer is FAST.  I mainly use this web browsing, and the speed is 10x faster than my old laptop (which was a cheaper $250 version).  Opened multiple tabs at once - no issues.  Netflix is WAY faster than my old computer too.  I have not tried word processing, etc, but I'm sure it will be fine.  Google apps are easy to browse/find.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially as it is much cheaper than any other option.
Update: after about a week, I'm still very pleased with this Chromebook.  As some reviewers have said, the display is not that great for watching Netflix (it still streams faster than my previous laptop), but is perfect for web browsing etc. Also, I use a Nike running (GPS) watch that I tried to connect to the Chromebook, but found out there is no app for it :>(

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent units with rechargeable batteries (included) and the privacy codes necessary to modify the basic channels if desired. These units are able to communicate universally with other units, even if a privacy code is being used. We had originally purchased a less expensive toy-like Motorola set for use with our car club but they were lacking the privacy code capability used by our club and thus useless to us. They were returned for these units and we are now in full communication again."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is so much nicer than the picture shows. It's just like one that is more expensive. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great quality and the sound did not seem any different then when using a more expensive audio extension cable. I would recommend this product to anyone.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"OK, they're couplers.  They have one function, to join 2 cables that end in male RCA jacks.  They do it.  The fit is snug and the contact is positive.  The color coding is a convenience that's nice to have.  Red for right, eh."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I bought this as an extra long cable for using it in the car for a long road trip.  Cable working great so far.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Very nice lens and a useful range (10-18) for the Canon APS-C sensors.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,Seems to work most of the time I've only had it for a short while and some times I have to play with the plug to get it to work and the pie shows the low power working every 10 minutes
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I own a video production business, and my clients have DVD players that range in the Piece of S*** category, to reliable brands like Sony, Pioneer and Denon. These Memorex discs play on them all! I have never had one fail to play due to a manufacturing defect. Not once. I have a stock DVD burner on my Systemax editing computer, and the Memorex discs play and record on it fine. And you can't beat that the price for a spindle of 100 is cheaper than WalMart."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Superb finish and a serious photography tool.  This camera does almost everything one could ask for.  It has few limitations, like no built in HDR, that are easy to get around using manual techniques.  Both jpg and raw files are excellent.  Highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a long term investment for a photography tool."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,Stopped working after less than a year.  Don't waste your money.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Amazon saved me a bunch of money on this terrific radar detector.  It will drive you crazy with false alerts unless you disable ""POP Mode"".  Once POP Mode is turned off it stops falsing and it works as well as those $300 dollar (and higher) models.  I have been using it for a while now and it has saved me from many unpleasant experiences.  If you are looking for top of the line detection at under 200 bucks then this is your unit.  Take a look on-line and you will find that this baby has detection capability that rivals the heavy hitters (BEL and Escort)."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This insanely cheap router outdoes everything else that is under $100. It can handle streaming movies and multiple games at once no problem. I imagine if you have a family of 4 or more all using devices maybe you would hit some caps, but it has been nothing but great for me."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I strongly suggest you ""try"" to call acer/gateway tech service before you buy any of there junk. They want to charge 129. 00-200. 00 for help on the phone. Sure its got a warranty but after that I wish you the best. Also if you look at the manual you'll notice something missing. Thier phone number. Try to find it online if you can. They have a 1-800 number but all it is for is to give you the run around. Best of luck with this company. never again! They eat power cords every few months. They have recalls going on for burning and thats what this P. O. S. did and I could not get in touch with them so I called BBB. Theres bad service and there ""NO SERVICE"" its a big difference!  ACER/GATEWAY SUCKS!!!!!!

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The good news: The headphones work great. The Mic is clear and the buttons are perfectly located for my 68 year old hands.
The bad news: They are to small for my big head, if they come down another .250 Inch they would fit perfectly. Because they work and sound so good I will live with .250.

Picture the set on a head. There is a very sharp teat on the top left side of the black plastic piece that slides down. I was able to remove them (on both sides) with no problem but it is sharp enough to scratch a small finger."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"It is a bit more light weight than I thought it would be, all in all, it is a very sturdy tripod. Although, there was an excess amount of lubricant on it when it first came. I use this with my canon T3i and am able to add a mount with an LED light and mic to."

disappoint ..."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"UPDATE: Amazon customer support did an exchange of the defective product free of charge.

We had great luck with this keyboard since we first started buying them in 2014. As we've expanded our office, we've added this keyboard from Kensington to each work station. However one of them has sticky keys and we didn't not set up the new office until a few days after the return process closed. Space bar double spaces with each click. Interested to see how customer service handles this."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"It works perfect once I installed it in my notebook. It was recognized immediately without any kind of problems, great product."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This product is awesome! One of the best cases I have purchased to date for both iPad 2/3 (which have been many). It includes a built in screen protector, and looks to be very solid. The case snaps in the the protective case and then is protected by the rubber around the sides. There are slots that are protected for the rear camera and speaker, and all ports are covered. Very nice for the price. Highly recommended!

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"As an update to my original review back in 2013: I began having problems with this about 8 months after I purchased it. It crashed 3 times over a matter of two years. I'm uncertain if it was caused by the demand from FSX but I do know something was notably wrong. To be fair, I may just have received a faulty piece of hardware. Nonetheless, after the third nose-dive; out it came. I didn't care about warranties at that point and I am thankful that my OS was not on it. Sadly, it was the worst hard drive that I ever had. I replaced it with a 250 GB SSD which has been magnificent. My current opinion is that Solid State is the only way to go."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I didn't realize for years that I didn't have a speaker on the MB is used to build my own PC.  I thought the reason I wasn't hearing the boot up beeps was because of my hearing loss.  Then I discovered that my cpu fan wasn't running and there wasn't any alarm for overheating nor stopped fan!  Yikes.  Now the beeps are back!  New fan and cooler cpu.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This monitor is gigantic, and a pretty good value.  I have really enjoyed using it, enough that I am thinking of buying one and carrying it to work.  I don't know if it really is better on the eyes, but it's beautiful."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"3 years later these are still my best online purchase ever. I have replaced the ear pads with some from a pair of Audeze LCD-2s and they are much more comfortable this way. After about a year and a half of heavy use, a hair got into the space between the driver and the screen and made a buzzing noise, but that was just a matter of taking it apart and removing it with a tweezer."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Works well... records games... but if you are looking to use it for recording anything else through your XBOX, it won't work. Its just game play, not Netflix or TV."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Per other reviews the cloth versions for the G930 don't work properly and the only ones that work correctly is the black one.  Yet, the pillow for the black versions doesn't work for the G930!  Catch-22 for those who have disintegrating pillows and ear pads.

The title is difficult to understand, as it contains so much information.  Titles and information needs to be clear and not ambiguous and this item title could be much clearer.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?"

  cheap enough also."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Fantastic sound and clarity for such a little speaker. Bluetooth works great too!
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"For the awesome price, this gets 5 stars. The battery life is amazing. I use them every day, and I probably charge them once a week. One thing you should be informed about: people keep breaking the charge port. I think this is because they are unnecessarily cramming the charger into the port. It's a tighter fit than any other micro USB, so just be gentle when plugging it in. I've not had a single problem."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This does work with the tablet, though you must connect it as a bluetooth device. Put it into search mode by holding both the triangle and circle buttons until the mic button flashes (may need to be charged first). You do lose some functions with it this way, but the voice search and other buttons work as intended. I had to search a lot to find that info, so hopefully it helps someone else out.
Bigger than I thought, about twice the size of the aluminum Apple TV remotes, but it is so much more comfortable to use as well. Great overall construction even if a little bit on the pricey side."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I recently bought this product, tried to install using installation CD, which locked up on the 9th step. Called tech support, was told the product, which was bought that day, was no longer under warranty as Lynksys bases warranty on production date, not date of purchase,(i'm not making this up!) so warranty expired while on Staples shelf. ""Manilla Mary"" told they would believe me this one time and give me a one time complimentary tech support session. Declined and went and exchanged for another of the same model, which had 9 months remaining on the one year warranty, spent 9 (yes, 9, i'm not joking) hours with ""Rangoon Randy"" ""Phillipine Phil"" etc over three nights only to find they are clueless on setting this up.  I still don't have a functioning router and don't know what the answer is but Lynksys most DEFINITLY isn't it."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"As many other people have reported, the vinyl is nice and heavy and very white. 9' x 20' is a great size for my studio.
I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll. So I had to re-roll the vinyl onto a cardboard core from a previous roll of seamless paper."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This battery allows me to shoot all day without worrying about how much juice I have left. This kind of peace of mind is priceless. A professional battery for professional photographers that gets the job done.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This works a lot better than I expected.  I also thought it would be a lot harder to work with than it was. We have a HDTV, surround sound with receiver, two video game systems, a DVD player, a Roku, wires going to the speakers and a cable box. Our television is mounted up on the stand's mounts so the wires are dangling and also bunched up on the floor behind the stand. By using this, I was able to group all the wires and cords together then run them up in a single Promaster sleeve so it looks like a pipe coming up from the ground instead of a bunch of dangling wires. The floor has no clutter at all now. What I did was plan everything before starting it. I think it could become frustrating if not planned out. It only took about 20-25 minutes to do all this and now we have a nice and neat entertainment area."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is a great device. I use it at ballgames because of the FM radio and the fact that it fits comfortably in my pocket. The videos play well and the available storage and SD card slot means I have plenty of ways to carry my picture along to share. The ear buds have a great sound because of the X-FI technology. I have been very pleased with this and all of the products I have purchased from Creative. Creative is a very economical alternative to the I-pod.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"As usual, a quality product from Anker.  Had many other cables that would charge some devices but not others.  This cable works for all, and at 6 ft is a convenient length.  A velcro strip attached near the end of the ""big connector"" end is a thoughtful addition allowing you to loop the cord for storage or to neatly reduce the length during use.  Definitely recommend."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Nice reasonablely priced set of speakers. Easy to hook up and do not take a lot of room.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I got this for my Lenovo x200t, which has a displayport in the docking station. Now I can use dual monitors when docked (this may not be possible with all computers, but the x200t allows you to use the VGA and Displayport concurrently to duplicate or extend the display.) It is too short to connect the display but easily connects to the DVI-D cable I already had for my flatscreen monitor.

I would have given it five stars if it weren't so expensive - it seems overpriced for how simple it is, but others were even more so what can I say? Apple owners might be used to paying extra but as a PC user I was surprised at the high price. It does the trick though and was worth it to get dual monitors working!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this product a year ago. I got the pink one and it's  quite eye catching. But beyond that, it does what it promises to do. Nothing changed with the product and it does protect my Ipod touch. It's sturdy and comfortable to use. I will recommend it to anyone."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This product is truly amazing. I hadn't heard of this product but with a car as old as mine, I thought I was forced to listen to radio or burn my own CDs.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great durable cables!  I need to order more, these cables perform if not better than expensive cables. No signal loss at all."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I use this to backup pictures and videos after my old external hard drive got full. It has faster read and write speeds than my old drive (which was also USB 3) and it can hold much more (my old drive was 1TB which formatted down to around 900GB). Sturdy construction and it fits great inside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-External-Case/dp/B00HEEOQBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics External  Case</a>. Very happy with its performance and portability."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,Looks to be of a good quality. I've tested it in and my lab and everything seemed to work properly.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This PRO is worth the money over their EVO line; and not the same animal. Although EVO is excellent bang for the buck, and both smoke any disc drive; this is the near future for state of the art storage that still retains an impeccable reliability value. Samsung is the #1 player is both of these considerations for fixed memory technology, and once you choose SSD, there's no reason to risk performance security and longevity by saving 30% on the older SSD technology of the EVO. The 10 year warranty says it all."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great purchase
Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Speed is fine and all, but sometimes it 'vanishes' from my Macbook and I have to reinstall the drivers.  I'm not talking about after an OSX upgrade or patch, just one day it's there and the next it's not.  I have this on a USB hub on my monitor that gets moved from the Macbook to a windows system and it works on both which is what you would expect.  Never has issues under windows 10."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I got these at a discount for my honest review. These come in handy for cleaning your screen on your electronics. They are not real big, so I also carry a couple in my purse to clean my glasses  They work well."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Works extremely well. Previously I had crappy ones from Walmart (constantly deleted my files, never working, etc.). This works perfectly. I have had it for a few months - not one issue. The boxing it come in is super professional (it looked like it was from Apple lol). Very high quality feel, design, and performance."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This bag is working out perfectly for my wife in her new job. She never removes it from the wheels as it takes a couple minutes to convert over and isn't really hard to shoulder carry with the wheels.
Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Adhesive isn't great (using in a vehicle where the temperature varies significantly).

The opening is also too wide for a single charging cable (iphone) and will not hold it in place.

Probably works fine for indoor use on larger diameter cables."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is one of the draw backs of the Olympus Brand digital camera.  The XD cards are more expensive than the SD cards and made me kind of shy away from the Olympus products.  This adapter makes it very affordable for picture storage.
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I have one of these on a MacBook Pro Retina mid 2012 and it has worked great for more than a year along with Sabrent's 5v power supply.  I bought a second one (with power adapter) to put on a my spouse's 2017 iMac 27 and it caused the Mac to hard crash and need to be unplugged and then plugged back in (SMC reset) to restart.  I replaced the provided USB cable with this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-USB-Type-C-to-Micro-B-3-1-Gen2-Cable-3-Feet-0-9-Meters-White/dp/B01GGKYJG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics USB Type-C to Micro-B 3.1 Gen2 Cable - 3 Feet  (0.9 Meters) - White</a>&nbsp;which also removes the need for an external power supply.  In fact, if you leave the 5v supply plugged in the hub won't work with the USB C cable.  I don't know why the Sabrent causes the iMac to crash, I tried it on my 2012 MacBook and it worked fine, but the combo of this hub with a USB C cable is a cleaner install and the USB C cable is cheaper than the external power supply and you get one less wall wart in your life."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.
They stay put
They are light
I like them and I will be using them for all of my future runs and gym workouts.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,Great sound. Great microphone. Connects with no problem. Excellent battery life.
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,Short and simple this item is overpriced and a total disappointment. Going straight back for a refund.
